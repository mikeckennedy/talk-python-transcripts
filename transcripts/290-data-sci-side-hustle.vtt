00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.320
Are you a data scientist looking to branch out on your own and start something new?

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.700
Maybe you're just looking for a way to work with those exciting libraries that aren't yet

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.220
in play at the day job. Rather than putting everything on the line, quitting your job,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.160
and hoping things work out, maybe you should start a side hustle. On this episode, you'll

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.960
meet Keith McCormick, a data scientist who has many irons in the fire, and he's here to tell us

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.320
about the different types of side hustles and why you might want to try or avoid a certain one.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.860
This is Talk Python To Me, episode 290, recorded October 1st, 2020.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:49.100
Welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the ecosystem,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.560
and the personalities. This is your host, Michael Kennedy. Follow me on Twitter where I'm at

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.840
I got a joke for you. What's the world's most popular IDE? Excel. Funny, right? Except many

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.180
companies really do run on Excel to the point where they would be much better off using clean and simple

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.640
programming tools. For many, Python's data science stack would be vastly better. But moving from Excel

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.800
to Python is a challenge. Most data science courses don't focus specifically on the Excel use cases.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.700
That's why we've teamed up with Chris Moffitt from Practical Business Python to create a course

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.360
tailor-made for helping people learn just enough pandas in Jupyter to replace the problematic Excel

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.500
usage with clean and scalable Python code. If you or your coworkers are ready to move beyond Excel,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.880

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.960
online course at Talk Python Training. Keith, welcome to Talk Python To Me.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.520
Thanks very much. I look forward to it.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.640
I'm really excited about this topic. As folks who listen to the show know, I'm very excited about

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.040
entrepreneurship, about software businesses, businesses built on open source. And so many of

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.840
these things often I think they seem inaccessible to folks because, well, they've got a mortgage to pay,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.380
or they've already got a job, or they don't have a chance to just go through some Y Combinator,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.460
accelerator type experience, and then pop out with VC money on the other side. And we often hear about

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.500
people creating side hustles. And for some reason, maybe it's just the world I live in, the water I swim in.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.400
But to me, I hear that so often on the software development side, especially the front end

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.160
development side, but not on the data science side so much. So that's what we're going to talk

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.480
about today is side hustles for data scientists.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.200
Yeah, I'm excited. When I reflect back, I've never really thought that I had any special

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.540
skills or knowledge. But just within the last couple of years, looking back, I said, well, gosh,

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:05.100
I've been doing this on my own for 25 years. Only briefly was I full time. I must have learned

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.880
something during that time. So I never thought I had a story to share. But I guess if you do it this

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.680
many years, I've definitely picked up some things.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.040
I would think so. And congratulations. That's awesome. You've definitely cracked the code and

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.760
made it work if you can do it for 25 years.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.860
I was just going to say that depending on how you count, I guess it's been longer than that,

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.640
because I finished undergrad in 91 and I've only had one W-2 style job. I was an army scholarship. I

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.100
guess that counts as a traditional job. But I ran a tutoring company. I wasn't a data scientist yet,

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.240
but I ran a tutoring company because I had done some SAT prep, you know, the college prep stuff after.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.600
So maybe that's how I got the entrepreneurial bug. I don't know. But if you start counting from there,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.340
even though I wasn't doing data science as an entrepreneur, I guess we're at 30 years.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.120
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I was going to say, I'm a relative rookie. I've only been doing this for

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.560
five years on my own.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.240
And I think the market is probably different. I mean, who knows what it would be like if I were

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.500
to start the clock all over again. So that will probably be part of what we can uncover is how

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.860
much.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.760
Yeah, I totally agree. And I would say it's easier and it's harder. It's easier because it's easier to

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.640
get the word out. It's cheaper, right? We have all of these async communication and collaboration

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.240
things. We've got GitHub, we've got Zoom, and yet there are now millions of people vying for that

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.980
same attention. So getting noticed, I think, is actually harder. So there's like this, you're more

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.880
capable of getting the word out, but there's because of that so many people trying. So I think that

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.700
it's still challenging, but in a different way somewhat.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.660
You know, I think you're exactly right. Back in the nineties, if you had a conversation about this

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.360
kind of stuff, potential client would say, you know about that? We need to find somebody that

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.880
knows something about that. It's not like there was a lot of competition. You were the person they knew

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.400
that knew about this stuff.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.500
Yeah. Yeah. You could write a book and then that would get you, well, that's the expert. They wrote

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.280
the book. All right. Now it's like, it's not necessarily going to do it. All right. So I'm super

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.140
excited to dive into all these things, but let's start with your story. How did you get into

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.740
programming and how do you get it? I know you're not exclusively or even primarily doing Python in

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.080
your data science work, but let's talk a little bit about how you got into Python anyway.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.760
Sure. Well, perhaps I should mention how I got into data science and then pick up the programming

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.860
piece. Sure. So the way that I got into data science was the way that most of us did who got

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:35.360
into this in the nineties. Back then it was expected that you had a substantial statistics background.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.040
Now I think you can get away without that, but at the time that was just table stakes. You just had

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.800
to have a stats background. So I somewhat stumbled into statistics. I studied computer science as an

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.100
undergrad, not statistics, but I was contemplating grad school and I had to do something to pay the

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.680
bills. So I was looking for ways to do that. That wouldn't be full-time. And I got an opportunity

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:06.460
to teach introductory classes for SPSS, the company that made the famous statistics software.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:12.100
Right. This is kind of like MATLAB, but it was focused. It's a tool focused on statistics explicitly.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.920
And it was really popular in the nineties. Yeah.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:20.000
Yeah. And boy, I mean, it's just been around forever. So it actually, I'm in my early fifties.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.520
I was born in 68 and that's actually the year that SPSS came out. So I'm SPSS and myself were the same

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.500
age. And SAS, which of course is also famous, came out just a couple of years later, 71 or something like

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.500
that. So they've both been around for a half century. It's really remarkable. And you're right. In the

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:43.380
nineties, they largely dominated the statistics space, but they also completely and utterly dominated

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.920
the predictive analytics space because at the time in the late nineties, they were the only game in town.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:56.280
So in SPSS, it was a product called Clementine, which is now an IBM product. So it now is called

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:04.140
a somewhat odd name, IBM SPSS modeler. And SAS, shortly after Clementine came out and made something

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.660
called enterprise minor. And those were really the tools that people used if they were interested in

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:14.940
this kind of stuff. So I backed into Python. I mean, I had studied computer sciences in undergrad. So

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:20.900
certainly the notion of coding and thinking programmatically made a lot of sense to me,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:29.440
but SPSS Inc for whatever series of reasons chose to make Python, the scripting language in both SPSS

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.660
statistics and SPSS modeler. So we don't think of those tools. If folks are familiar with them,

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.440
I don't think of those tools as having a programming component, but just like Excel has macros,

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:47.480
these tools have considerable programming options as well. And they decided that the languages that

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.140
were around in 68 weren't exactly cutting edge anymore.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.520
Cobalt's just not doing it. People don't love it for some reason.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:02.180
For a time, organizations were desperate for COBOL programmers, all of which were basically

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:08.720
semi-retired, but would be pulled out of retirement to get crazy hourly fees to fix ancient COBOL code

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:14.400
that I'm not quite old enough to be a COBOL person. But yeah, the equivalent, you know, like SPSS

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:22.100
modeler initially had a kind of a prologue type, that more 90s AI language type stuff.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.220
Oh, wow. Yeah. Okay.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.520
Stuff like that was the basis of how you would do some basic scripting and modeler. So both SPSS

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:34.260
statistics and SPSS modeler needed to be renovated in terms of their scripting language. And Python was

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:41.100
the one that was adopted. So I sought out experts on Python to mentor me. And I took a class with Mark

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:47.300
Lutz, which some people might know because he wrote this big doorstopping comprehensive encyclopedic

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:52.600
O'Reilly book on the subject. And then not only- Yeah, this is a massive book. It was a good book.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.840
It is a good book, especially at the time. I think this was like 2005 or so. So in a sense,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.180
I was early to the party. And in another sense, I'm still late to the party in that I've been using

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:08.240
these tools for so many years. I'm definitely not a Python all the time kind of a guy.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.900
Excellent. Yeah, that's really cool. And it sort of SPSS sort of dragged you into it. That's cool.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:19.160
So how about now? I always like to ask people what they're doing day to day. So folks listening,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.960
get a sense of where you're coming from. How do you spend your time and stuff?

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.620
Sure. No. Well, let's just kind of finish up on the tool thing because folks might,

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.640
after having heard all that, they might be kind of curious, kind of what my GoTool generally is.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:40.200
So the first book that I wrote was on SPSS Modeler. So I'm well-known in that community

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:47.240
because it wasn't just my book. It was the first book on that subject. And I gathered all of us that

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:52.240
were well-known in that community and ended up being this group thing. And I was lead author. So

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.640
I'll always be well-known in that community, but that community is shrinking in importance relative

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:03.320
to others because it's no longer one of two options like it was 20 years ago, clearly. And it's not the

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:08.980
dominant option because Python is the dominant option. So I'm known for that, but it's not a big part of my

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:16.020
consulting anymore. So the tool that I like to use, if I'm just doing a workshop where I'm working with a

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:21.800
client that's really just starting out and we don't want to be distracted by the tool, we just want to be able to

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:27.040
talk about the project is nine. And that's a predictive analytics workbench that's open source

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.900
that obviously isn't nearly as known as Python, but has kind of a growing following. And the only reason

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:36.760
I use that is that if I'm working with a client, I don't want to be focused on the project within an

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.300
hour or so we can be doing very basic stuff. And then the tool fades into the background, which I like.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:46.640
But then for all the other clients, I just use whatever they use. And I find that I can be helpful to

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.720
them without having to worry about that.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.820
Right. Probably a lot of Jupyter, some R, some Python.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.840
All of the above.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.340
Yep.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.280
Yep. All right. Day to day. How do you spend your time?

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:02.780
Well, in some ways it's easier to talk about how I kind of carve up my year because let's say I'm

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:03.780
going to speak at a conference.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:08.180
It's not like you just work for one company 50 weeks a year, then you got two weeks off, right?

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.400
You've got probably, as we're going to talk about, a mix of things you're doing for different

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.560
companies and different people, right?

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.760
Absolutely. Yeah. So it's not even just...

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.700
So if, for instance, if one week I was going to work for client A and then the next week I was

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.540
going to work for client B, then you would get a sense that my day to day might be somewhat more

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:30.440
like someone that was on salary. But my year is all over the place because the clients that work

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:35.860
with me, generally speaking, I'm not building the predictive model. I'm usually helping them run

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.540
their teams. And the reason I've gravitated towards that is it feels right at this stage in my career,

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:46.720
but also because it fits my schedule better. Because if I'm going to give a talk and a workshop

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:52.060
in Amsterdam or something, I want to be able to tune out and not worry about being up in the middle of

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:56.540
the night on some client meeting or something like that. I'll tell my clients that I'm out of pocket

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:01.020
for a week or 10 days. And to be honest, if I couldn't do that, it probably wouldn't be fun because

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.940
these long flights, you get tired and you want to enjoy the fact that you're in Europe or you want

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.640
to enjoy the fact that you're in Kuala Lumpur or what have you. So the weeks that I'm at a conference,

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.940
I'm all about the conference. And I'm really just giving an out of office reply for email,

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:21.020
but my clients will know that I'm going to be out of pocket for a week or two. So that's maybe 20%

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:26.800
of my year is that kind of travel. Oh, the other thing that I'll do that some of my colleagues don't

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.680
have the time to do depends on if they have kids and the age of their kids and different things like

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.640
that. But a lot of my colleagues have to run home to catch the soccer game or whatever.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:42.300
I'm single without kids, so that's not an issue for me. So I'll tend to stay traveling. And that

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:49.640
really becomes a really fun part of it for me. Yeah. So that's a substantial chunk. And then most of the

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:57.200
consulting that I'll do is more like on a retainer basis. So I might have four or five hours with one

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.840
client and eight with another combined with other things. And of course, the piece that if folks

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:08.480
haven't done a lot of freelancing, they have to be prepared for is you have to be interacting with

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:15.340
new clients, scoping projects, you know, maybe sending out invoices or project proposals.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:20.280
And that's a constant thing. If you're not doing that all the time, you're going to suddenly reach

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:25.000
the end of a project and realize that you have nothing going on. So that's constantly happening.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.940
And it's something that it's hard to get prepared for. How do you get started doing that? You know,

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:34.880
it's one thing to say, okay, I've been working at this company for three years. I'm really good at

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:40.700
X, you know, building APIs, doing either doing this type of data analysis, whatever. But that's only half

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:46.900
of the story. Like if you want to go into consulting or go into speaking and you've got to build these

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:52.820
relationships and build that. It's almost like a funnel, but for your career instead of for a product.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:59.120
Well, absolutely. It's very much a funnel. I think part of it is, is that at a certain point in my career,

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:06.600
I would have this kind of boom or bust situation, which is quite common when people try to consult.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:13.560
But it's especially true when you're doing a 40 hour week for one client. So at this stage of my career,

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.980
I never do that anymore. I would have had to accept those kinds of gigs years ago to pay the bills.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:24.020
But I've been kind of graduated past that, so to speak, because if you are working with one client,

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:29.720
40 hours a week for 10 weeks, you got to start from scratch that next Monday. And that's really,

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:35.680
really tough. So this more retainer like relationship that I have with my clients now,

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.760
I never want to be working with fewer than three to five clients at a time,

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:45.240
because it's not like all five of them are going to suddenly reach project end simultaneously.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.360
All right. I need you.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.480
So that's the trip.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:53.500
Yeah. I've heard of this term called productized consulting, where it's a little bit like what

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:58.100
you're talking about. You know, maybe if your job is to maintain Django websites,

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:04.020
instead of saying you can pay me $150 an hour to maintain your site, you could say you can subscribe

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:11.540
to my sort of site maintenance service and you pay me $2,000 a month and I will jump on a problem

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:16.700
for up to this amount of time, like almost like a mechanic or a lawyer who needs to jump in and

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.200
solve a problem. And it sounds a little bit like that.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:26.760
It's very much like, I think it's very much like a lawyer in that if you adopt that kind of a style,

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.840
now, of course, at this stage of my career that I'm doing somewhat more analytics management

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:36.140
consulting, right? I'm working with the VP of analytics or some director level. So my particular

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.880
work at this moment in time is a little bit different than what you were describing, but a

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.240
subscription like that is a fabulous, fabulous idea because that's exactly how you want to do it.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:51.320
And clients are not going to know if at any given moment you end up with a 65 hour week.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.600
If a gig comes in and you say, you know, I've got something ramping up and I've got something

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:01.340
coming to an end. I can power through this one week. I'm going to go ahead and do a 65 hour week.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.680
And I'm going to do that knowing that if you didn't do that, you might have a 20 hour week.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.020
Otherwise, right.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.180
If you're subscribing a subscription model or a retainer model like that,

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.120
you can do that and you just power through the busy times.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:19.240
Right. And then you've got that predictable income. You can also do that to have a different

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:25.200
type of lifestyle, not just to sort of smooth out the income differences, right? You can decide

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.120
I'm going to power. It looks like there's a lot of work these two months. I'm going to just power

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.480
through that. Then I'm going to take a month off and go to Hawaii and I can do that because that's

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:38.280
just what I want to do. And it's Christmas time anyway. Like work is down. You know, it gives you

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:43.640
that ability to, to make different trade-offs. Whereas if your job is to be in a cubicle,

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.760
because they want you there for eight hours a day, 40 hours a week, like those trade-offs

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.600
are much harder to make.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:54.380

Absolutely. Absolutely. So, and of course, you have the option of working from Hawaii. So,

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:07.640
what I did for years, now of course, we're all still trying to figure out what long-term, if not

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:12.760
permanent impact, COVID-19 is going to have on our work lives. I think we all think that we're going to

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:17.560
be working remotely a lot more than we ever did, right? But we're still sorting out all of that. But for

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:26.600
years, I would look at a map and look at my calendar and say, "Wow, I've got to be in Munich the third week

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:33.560
of June, and I've got to be in Amsterdam the first week of June. I'm going to spend the whole month of

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.040
June in Europe."

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:34.040
Yeah.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.280
"Italy. Why not?"

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:45.720
"It's not that hard to take daytime U.S. calls in the early evening and just plan your day around that."

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.360
Yeah, absolutely. I lived for a year in Germany and I just had, my work day was like two in the

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.800
afternoon until 10 PM. And it was great. I just had the mornings to myself.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.000
Yeah. It can be fantastic.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:55.880
For the family.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:02.920
Yeah. So I think that's the stage for some really nice ideas, some really nice lifestyles and freedom

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:10.200
and whatnot. But often I think people see it as a switch, right? I hear people talking like,

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:15.160
"I'm going to save up a bunch of money. I've got this idea. And when I'm ready, I've got enough runway

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:19.720
that I can go for this long and I'm going to quit my job and I'm going to start this thing." And to me,

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:27.480
that seems really, really risky. A much better idea is if it's possible, can you build up

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:33.320
some thing and show that you have traction in it? Because if you can get it to work and you can get

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:39.240
traction in training and speaking in all these different areas that we might be talking about

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.160
coming up, if you can find traction in there when you're doing it two hours a day, well,

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.560
all of a sudden, if you can put all your energy into it, it's very likely to be successful. But if

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:52.520
it's not, if it's just going to spin and get no attention, then it's going to really be quite

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.920
devastating if you blow your whole life savings on it.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:20:00.120
Oh, the flipping the switch. I don't think it's too blunt to just say, "Terrible idea." If you can

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:00.600
avoid it.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.080
Yeah.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:06.360
I'm sure somebody out there has managed to pull it off, but maybe I can help kind of describe the

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:15.000
context of when, what starting out was like. So I can't imagine that the technical training is ever

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.240
going to go away. Now it's very different now than it was when I started because we have Udemy and all

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:26.520
kinds of platforms where there's a lot of content. So the kind of classroom training that I did where I

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:31.480
was teaching classes that were three, four or five days long. You don't see that as much before. But

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:36.840
when I started out doing that, I was getting paid by the day. And this is something that probably

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:44.040
people don't think about, but was huge in my life at the time was that since I was in my late twenties,

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:50.120
teaching these introductory stats software classes, most of my colleagues were full-time, but I was getting

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:58.840
paid by the day. So I would basically say that I'll teach this stuff anywhere. I don't care if you need

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:06.120
somebody in Seattle or Texas or overseas or whatever, I'll do it. Okay. A lot of the folks that were on

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:11.560
salary didn't necessarily have to travel because a lot of times they were assigned to the Chicago office

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:19.240
or the New York office. Long story short, I actually had more training days per year than most of my

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:25.560
salaried colleagues had. Wow. So I had a crazy schedule, had an intense schedule, but you can imagine it was

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:30.680
good money because actually, because I was getting paid a contract rate for more days. And because I would

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:37.880
sometimes do 13 five day weeks in a row, which is usual for a contract situation like that. What it did is

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:43.880
it put me in front of a lot of people. And it meant that if some kind of short-term engagement came along, it was

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:48.520
just a matter of me blocking out two weeks on my calendar. It was really as simple as that. I didn't even have to have a

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.920
conversation. I just had to say first half of April, I'm tied up. Don't assign me anything.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:59.400
Yeah. That's fantastic. So let's start there in terms of some of the side hustle potentials. I think

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:05.740
this professional training, this in-person training, even sans COVID, right? We got to put that caveat

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:12.420
out there, but yeah, in the normal world, this in-person training and maybe virtual resume or online

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.900
training, this is a pretty good way to do it because for most jobs, I feel like you can make this

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:23.180
something that you can do without your company completely freaking out, right? So if you're a

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:28.940
data scientist for say a tractor manufacturer in the Midwest, you could make the case like, let me

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:35.520
take an unpaid week every two months and do one of these courses. It will make sure that I'm on top of

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:40.680
my game and that I'm a better person for you. And I can help give some internal presentations as part of

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.020
my regular job and stuff. Like that's a pretty good story. You can tell without flipping the switch

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:49.840
that will get you exposure to these clients that you can reach out to if you want to go further and so

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.800
on. What do you think about that?

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:56.100
Absolutely. So let me amplify that even more. I think if someone were to have this kind of

00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:01.620
conversation with their boss, this isn't a crazy scenario at all. Hey, there's this cool conference

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:07.820
happening out in Vegas. There's a chance that I could present one of our client case studies and kind

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:12.160
of promote the company. They're not paying me to give the talk, but they, you know, I've talked to the

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.800
conference organizers and they think my proposal would have a good chance of being accepted.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:21.720
I get to talk for like an hour and then don't just do that. Right. You might then have free travel

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.640
and you're getting paid. You're on your salary, given that presentation, you know, for the boss,

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:31.380
but then take maybe just like two days off, but stick around and hang out the rest of the conference

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:35.980
because a lot of travel budgets are a lot of times they sell, you're going to give a one hour talk on a

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.820
Monday, then fly out on the Sunday and then, you know, fly back on the Monday night, which very early

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:47.580
on, I just knew that was not my style. Right. So yeah. Stay an extra day, sleep in and just have a

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.340
day where you just travel and just chill and don't make it a stressful experience.

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:54.900
Well, I'd want to get professional development in there too, though, which is like a key point.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:59.760
So sure. Do some Vegas. Everybody thinks of a casinos, but there's also some awesome hiking

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.960
out there. You can really do the outdoorsy thing in Vegas too, if you care to, but I would definitely

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.960
want to make sure that I was attending the conference too, not just speaking and then

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:14.080
rushing back. But then on top of all of that, see if there isn't a way to score a pre or post

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:21.520
conference workshop. Most conferences have them. Okay. So maybe somebody is really fantastic at

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:27.060
particular Python package, or they've got some skill. Maybe they're an early adopter of something new.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:32.060
Reach out to the conference organizers and say, I noticed that you've got a post conference

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.700
workshop and X, Y, and Z. Would you add one on my topic?

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:41.420
Yeah. Or even be a little more preemptive about it and just like apply to do that workshop far in

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:45.000
the future. Right. Right. When the call for proposals or call for papers opens.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.780
Sure. You absolutely could do that. But in my experience, sometimes the paid stuff is curated.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:52.240
Okay.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:58.880
So it's not so much proposal based. It's more like the draw, right? All conference organizers need

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:04.380
two kinds of content. They need the kind of content that they offer so that everybody gets a chance to

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:10.360
speak. That's like the case studies and stuff. And then you need the draw. The keynotes are being paid.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.940
And that's presumably why people want to go to the conferences to see the keynote. With concurrent

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:19.440
sessions, let's face it, for all to be honest, we kind of cross our fingers with one of those concurrent

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.680
sessions and we hope they're good. But usually we don't expect that much. We just hope that we're

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.800
wrong about that. It turns out to be great. But you expect the keynotes to be great and you expect the

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:32.700
pre and post workshops to be great. So in my experience, you have to kind of sell yourself

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.880
on the conference organizer that one, they want to add that topic and that you'd be a good person to

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.920
present it. But if you do that, now you're getting paid to go to the conference by your boss.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:46.360
You're taking a couple of days off. And I would be upfront with my boss about that kind of thing.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.780
Because they were like, somehow you talk them into giving a workshop on that topic.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.720
That's fabulous.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.380
You know?

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:57.460
Yeah. Yeah. And I think the story you tell is this is making me a better developer, better data

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:02.480
scientist for as one of your employees, I'm coming back better. Right. And it doesn't cost you

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:08.140
anything. And yet it builds these relationships and it builds these funnels. So let's talk just a

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:14.540
little bit more about getting in the training side of things. So one of the challenges is I want to

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:18.960
get into training is making those connections. So you can do speaking and you can do blogging and

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:24.600
other stuff to make those connections. But then you get a big company, they call you up and say,

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.560
we want this. And that's interesting, but we also need this variation and that other thing.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:33.880
And you have very little materials to present from, right? You've got to go and basically write

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:40.720
your educational materials. Or you can go and work for some established training company that

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.980
already has those relationships, already has the materials and just need somebody to put it all

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:50.400
together, someone to actually do the presentation. So that's another option. There's so many companies

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:57.520
that have these like very loose consulting relationships with experts, right? Places like

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.860
Wentelect and other companies that, right, they've got the sales team, they have the relationships,

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:06.100
they have the materials generally, but they need people to, who are experts.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:11.520
Yeah, that's all very true. But I think the first step, the first step isn't the entrepreneurial

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:17.460
step. That's more like the second step. The first step is you kind of have to be almost like a secret

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:23.900
shopper and research in a topic that you feel well-versed in or that you're super intrigued with,

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:27.360
right? I mean, it could be something you haven't mastered yet. You're, you got some confidence,

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:32.540
but you're super excited about it. You have to research how people that want to learn more about that

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:38.760
topic, get trained because that's indirectly going to lead you to what that training market is like.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:46.180
So it could be the vendor that, for instance, I use RStudio. I know they do webinars and things.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:52.780
I don't, I've never researched that market, like how much RStudio does workshops. I'm sure they do,

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:59.400
but that's where you would start. You'd be, how many conferences are there a year? I'd even get very

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:05.500
specific about it. I would say, oh, I found this cool topic. How many times can I find this offered

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:10.900
a year? Is it always the same instructor? That's one of the first things I look for. Is it somebody

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:16.240
that is in one particular topic? Let's say, for instance, I happen to be a GG plot two fan. So

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:21.960
obviously sometimes you'd have Hadley Wickham given some kind of GG plot two talk. If he's the only one

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:26.480
that's talking about it at all the R conferences at this point, there'd be enough demand for it that that

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:30.220
would no longer be the case. But if it's always him and you're going to be competing with Hadley

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:35.560
Wickham teaching GG plot two, not going to happen. Right. But I doubt that's what you would find if

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:40.280
you research that in 2020. I don't think he'd be the only one teaching GG plot two. So you'd seek out and

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:45.200
say, okay, how many conferences offered something like that? Were they part of the conference fee?

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:51.660
Were they a paid event in addition to the conference fee before, after? This is all the kind of stuff that you

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:57.500
have to know because naturally if it's part of the conference fee, it's probably free. Well,

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:02.060
it is free to conference goers. So therefore the conference organizer doesn't have a lot of cash to

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:09.300
spend on that. If it's a special additional expense before, after, and it's a topic that you're really

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:15.120
good at and think you could present well, what may be happening is sometimes they can't find someone in

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.720
a particular city to present that. So that's another thing too, is if someone lives in a medium

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:26.720
to large city, look for events coming to you. Maybe there's expert that isn't available to travel to

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:31.160
that one. If you're local, you don't have to charge travel to the organizer and they're going to like

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:35.920
that. Yeah, they do like that. That's definitely something you could promote to at least conferences

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:40.160
that cover travel and say, look, you don't have to pay for me. I'm already here. Or I can get myself

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:45.860
there with a car or a train for almost nothing. Another thing in this realm, while we're on this

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:54.360
side of the things is webcasts, webinar type things. So that's a lower bar, I think, often than speaking

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:59.920
at a conference, right? You can approach various groups, right? Like I know JetBrains has a bunch of

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:05.300
external people who give presentations on stuff. And if you're really good at some aspect of data science

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:10.080
and you're willing to like use their tools to present it, often they'll say, yeah, sure. We'll

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:15.420
use our platform and our audience to let you do that presentation. We just did one with Chris Moffitt

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:21.540
and had 1,100 people sign up with sending out one email and one, a couple of Twitter messages.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:26.740
That's a pretty big group of people at all. We didn't have to organize a conference or convince

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:31.520
anyone. We just put it on the internet and told people about it, right? So that's also an option.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:38.200
I agree. Now, the difference there is that there's a good chance that something like that

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:43.220
isn't going to get paid. I mean, obviously, sometimes I've been paid quite a few times to do

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:49.220
a webinar, but I've also done a ton of free ones, but absolutely to do it in terms of the visibility.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:54.520
And you've got to think that that option is just going to increase in frequency because whole

00:30:54.520 --> 00:31:00.600
conferences have gone online with COVID-19. And I think that may be permanent in that some conferences

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:05.420
will choose. I have this crazy theory that some conferences will go every other year,

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:09.980
every other year live and every other year online. I've never heard of anybody saying that,

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:14.620
but I just have a feeling that's going to happen. The other thing too, is that there's usually a team

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:20.640
for vendors that's in charge of such things. Like KNIME has what they call the evangelism team.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:25.380
Those are the folks, they're employees of KNIME that write the training materials and do various

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:32.040
things. But think about it. If you belong to that team, you don't always want to be the face of that

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.960
like all the time. You know that if you mix it up, it's going to be of interest. So if someone's willing

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:42.140
to volunteer an hour, now granted that hour webinar is going to take you a day or two to prepare.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:46.420
It may be stuff that you already know, not that you don't know it, you're going to prepare examples

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:50.140
and so on. So it's going to take some time, particularly if you're new at that kind of thing.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:55.980
But if you just simply found who the training team or the evangelism team with an organization

00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:00.340
like KNIME and just said, Hey, I've got this interesting topic. Do you have any webinar slots

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:05.300
coming up? I'd volunteer my time. I just, I'm excited about the topic and I want to share it

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:10.780
with the world. They're not going to turn you down. Yeah. Usually they're just looking for content like

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:14.860
that. Like, what are we going to do this month? I don't know. It's another month we're starting over.

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:19.140
Awesome. All right. So I definitely agree that those kinds of things are awesome for the visibility,

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:23.880
not for direct income, but they build that foundation that you can sort of branch out to.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:29.500
So we've covered training. We've covered conferences, consulting, I think mixes in there. We talked

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:34.800
about that. You mentioned books, but what about writing? Give us the story where you think the

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:40.120
data science side hustle of like writing books, maybe even magazine articles, if those are still

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.980
the thing. I know there's some that do pay actually for that. Even maybe reviewing a book.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:49.020
Yeah, no, that's interesting. Yeah. I think of like freelance writing like magazine articles. I think

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:54.800
of kind of people that spend 10 years sending short stories to the New Yorker and then I don't think

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.440
everyone picked up obviously in the tech now where it's very different. Exactly.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:04.600
Forbes. I haven't written Forbes, but they have an interesting model or even medium, things like

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:08.220
that. So that's not an area where I have a lot of experience, but absolutely. I think that is

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:14.840
available. I think I should probably briefly tell the story of my first book. So it came out in 2013.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:19.180
When would I would have started on that? The first one tends to take forever because you're learning

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:25.760
the ropes of just how books work. So I think that I probably wrote the proposal for that in 2011.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:33.840
So I would have been about 12 or more years into my career from like the busy part of my career even.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:39.040
And I was just always kind of scared to do it. I didn't even know how to start. But since I was well

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:44.560
known in the SPSS model or community, I reached out to, I don't know if everybody has heard the

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:50.020
acronym CRISP-DM. It's the cross industry standard process for data mining. It's very much on the

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:54.040
machine learning side. So some people may be familiar with it. Okay. I reached out to one of

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:59.820
the coauthors of CRISP-DM because I knew him. He knew me. And I said, why do you think it is that no

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:06.840
one's ever written a book on the basics of using SPSS modeler? And I knew him. I wasn't afraid to reach

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:11.680
out to him, but I did think that the chances that he would want to collaborate on something were slim

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:16.180
to none because he was so much more well-known than me. He was the author. It would be like,

00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:20.040
it'd be like doing something with a coauthor of Agile or something. You know what I mean? Just by

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:25.920
definition, he was well-known within the community. And what he said just stuck with me because I think

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:30.680
it's so often true. He said, I kind of always wanted to do it myself, but I was just too busy.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:37.820
So if you're less experienced, less well-known, but have the bandwidth, reach out to these people

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:43.240
that are expert and well-known because usually they have those two things, but they don't have

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:49.420
the bandwidth. And then there you go. You could pair up. So we put together an outline. I was all ready

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:54.260
to shop it around to publishers, something that I didn't know the first thing about how to do. I truly

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.760
didn't. I was completely lost in this project. All I knew was that I wanted to do it. And I had such an

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:04.400
amazing coauthor lined up that I felt like I couldn't fail. And out of the blue, I got a

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:11.420
LinkedIn message from a publisher that wanted to do a slightly different book. Now, keep in mind that

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:16.420
no one in the world, except for me and this one other person knew that we were working on an outline,

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:20.980
but it's just so funny that at that point in my life that I felt I was ready, somebody else decided I

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:27.840
was ready. So we skipped the intro book or rather we delayed it. And we ended up doing my first book,

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:31.940
which is a IBM SPSS model or cookbook. So the whole idea of a cookbook, and of course,

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:36.400
all the coders will know this is lots of short examples where you address something very specific.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:36.760
Right.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:43.940
And it's not like it's sold like Harry Potter, but since it was the first of its kind and the

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:47.760
publisher knew that, that's why they were looking for authors. See, that's what people don't realize

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:53.640
is that publishers have topics that they want addressed and they are seeking out authors to do that.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.700
I think it's just like when you apply to college.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:02.740
I get like every other week I get contacted by somebody. Hey, Michael, I'm the acquisition editor for so-and-so.

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:07.380
We're looking for a topic, a book on this. Are you interested? No, I'm trying to run my business.

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:07.800
Yeah.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.880
You're going to have to find someone else. I'm sorry, but this is just not. But yeah,

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.900
you're right. Because I still see that. I saw that last week.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:20.640
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And the thing is, well, you and I think have probably figured this out at this

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:26.580
stage in our careers is that the reason that they're reaching out to you is the things like this podcast

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:33.480
that you're doing. Right. But now that you're doing those things, you're busier. And not only that,

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.880
the other thing that people don't realize is that they probably think the first time they get an email

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:45.320
like that, oh my gosh, am I worthy of this inquiry from a publisher? They really want me to write a

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.640
book. That's so amazing. And then you realize eventually that it's almost like a spam thing,

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:55.500
that the concepts and publishers and book topics vary in quality. And then eventually you find out

00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:00.360
that not all of them are worth doing. But we put it together. And it was with, frankly,

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:04.920
one of these publishers that does reach out in that way. It's Pact is the name of the publisher,

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:08.820
because their whole strategy is they're super aggressive about the search engine optimization

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:13.680
thing. If they see that something's coming up in Google search and there's no book written about it,

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.700
they want a book about that right away. They want to be first to market.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:17.780
They're on it. Yeah.

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:25.280
So it's not like getting a contract with Random House or Wiley, or when you hear about these

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:29.880
politicians or famous people getting million dollar book advances, that is not the kind of book

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:35.100
deal that we're talking about, right? But they know that there's a hole in the market and they

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:39.620
want to find somebody to do it. So as long as somebody has a reasonable amount of competence,

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:44.560
that's going to be enough to be able to score the book deal. And what we were talking about earlier

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:49.480
is sufficient. I did three webinars on the topic. I did one conference workshop.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:49.960
Yeah.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:54.200
Somebody could achieve that in a year or two, and that would be sufficient. So I could have written

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:58.420
my first book years before I did it, but I was afraid to try.

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:03.940
Right. And if you don't have an audience, it's not a bad route to go. I think one of the really

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:08.960
big challenges of so much of this is getting awareness and getting attention and getting people

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:13.800
like you might build something amazing or you might create an amazing book or course or something.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:18.740
But if people don't pay attention to it, it doesn't matter. Right. It's just, it's such a busy

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:24.460
world. So like for me, it doesn't make sense for me to try to partner up with one of those guys and

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:29.580
spend a year and a half writing a book because I can reach so many thousands of people weekly through

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:34.840
the various podcasts and other formats that I have. But if I was working at a company, passionate about

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:40.440
a thing, but had basically zero following, it seems like a good choice for at least the first time.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.820
Well said, really, because you're not going to make money. You're not going to make money from

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:49.340
the book. Not these kinds of books, right? The only kinds of books where I'll meet authors that

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:56.900
make a pretty good income from the book is more the Harvard Business Review type on leadership,

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:01.900
communication. I guess one of the bestselling books of all time was The One Minute Manager.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:05.920
Somebody was just telling me that a couple of days ago. That's not the kind of books that as data

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:11.740
scientists we're going to write. So your mileage varies as they say, but we're talking,

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:17.340
you should be able to make a few thousand dollars, but, oh, I've got a great way to actually kind of

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:24.200
bracket what can be expected. Years ago, don't know her last name, but the Linda of Linda.com. I'm

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.860
embarrassed that I can't remember her last name because she's famous. She started a training business

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:33.780
and she was one of the first to realize that, oh, maybe we have to do like videotapes and DVDs.

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:37.140
This was not that long ago, but she started-

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.840
Yeah, this was 15 years ago, maybe. Yeah.

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:42.620
Maybe a little bit more than that. Could be-

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:43.260
Could be 20.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:48.140
Yeah, could be 20. And of course, she ended up selling to LinkedIn for 1.5 billion,

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:51.460
which is a really nice paycheck at the end. Not everybody's going to get that.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:56.460
But the reason I bring her up is because if people want to get an idea of what a home run

00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:00.660
is in the technical book space, because I don't know what people's expectations are, right?

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:06.320
But years ago, when Linda and her husband wrote their first technical book, I think they made

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:12.080
something like 60 or 80,000. So you're taking into account inflation, maybe that'd be like 100,000.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:19.780
That would be considered absolutely rock star, amazing, amazing, amazing royalties for a technical

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:23.880
book. Most people are going to be a 10th of that or less. Yeah.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:30.960
And I've read that a lot of books don't even sell 1,000 copies the first year. So that's an absolute

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.100
home run. So someone that thinks that they're going to retire on a book or something, not going to happen

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:41.200
because that might be one of the most successful technical books in recent memory because it's

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:44.940
notable because she used that to start her company. Don't count on that happening.

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:51.500
Yeah, absolutely. I think so many of these things can be thought of as layers that you add on that

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:56.920
allow the next step to be taken, allow the next thing to be successful, right? You're not necessarily

00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:01.120
going to get rich off of that book, but if you write the book and then you get well-known, you do some

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:05.700
speaking, and then you do this other thing, you do the startup, well, you might be in a much better

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.640
place to have that startup be successful if you hadn't done those things.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:13.360
Absolutely. You know, I had a conversation. It was a brief one-on-one conversation.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:17.520
It was a private conversation. It wasn't in a public setting, but I don't think there's any

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:23.900
harm in sharing it. I was chatting with Michael Berry, who some people may know because he kind

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:29.260
of does the conference circuit from time to time, but he's now head of business to business on TripAdvisor.

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:35.000
So he's a very successful data scientist. His co-author and friend, Gordon Lenoff,

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.700
has got a senior data science position at the New York Times. So they're both like super well thought of.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:43.060
He was in one of my training classes. Now, of course, at the time,

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:47.240
he was already an author and much more established than me. But the reason he was sitting in was

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:53.660
purely because he needed to learn the tool. So he was at the time a SAS person and wanted to learn

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:59.300
the SPSS equivalent. So you can imagine having a well-known person like that in class at the end

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:04.840
of each chapter. I would say, well, Michael, would you like to Michael's comment on Keith's chapter,

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:08.020
you know, kind of a thing. It was kind of fun, but he approached me during a break and he said,

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.440
Keith, you know, you seem to be pretty good at this. I noticed that your training,

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:15.960
I'm kind of surprised that you're not consulting. And the answer that I gave him was the thing about

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:21.080
consulting that's working for me right now is I'm doing a five-day week after a five-day week after

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:25.580
a five-day week. I mean, I just keep on getting my daily rate. And there was an age difference,

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:30.640
an experience difference. So I felt just a little bit bold to say, and I'm guessing that the way you

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:35.320
and Gordon have structured your consultancy is that you probably aren't billing 22 days a month.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.300
It probably doesn't work that way. He said, you're right. He said,

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:43.120
but you know what happens is when you have gaps in time, you have to use that effectively.

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:48.140
And what he and Gordon did is wrote their first edition of their book. They actually wrote several

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:51.980
books, but they said that was just when, whenever there was a week and the phone wasn't ringing,

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:56.760
we would chip away, chip away, chip away at the book. And when that first book came out,

00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:01.840
he said, the phone never stopped ringing after. We were slammed after the book came out.

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:06.780
So, and you know, that was their first book would have come out almost 30 years ago now.

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:12.540
And they've been full-time data scientists, freelance and salary that whole time. So it

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:16.980
really was the beginning of, they were already well-established, but the beginning of a very

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:20.420
successful career was writing that first book. So that's why you do it.

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.740
Yeah. Very interesting. Okay. So let's focus on a couple of other areas that I think

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:31.560
will be very exciting for people. I guess there's always the startup, right? And I think there's

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:36.400
some interesting areas in which data scientists can create startups, right? You can go and pull

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:41.180
different data together using screen scraping, using APIs, you know, all sorts of stuff. And you can

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:48.560
come up with inferences and trends and expectations. You can sell that data back to people, right? I think

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:55.240
that that's a really decent way to maybe create some kind of API or some kind of system where you really

00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:00.140
want to know about this market, not just this one thing. We've brought it all together. We've got the

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:05.880
infrastructure to keep it up to date and it's worth you to pay a hundred or a thousand dollars a month so that

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:10.740
you just get that data and you don't have a team that has to track it down and clean it and deal with it.

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:15.300
Yeah. And you know, this is really interesting because if you think about the story that I just

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:21.240
told about Gordon and Lenoff and in my own experiences being in my late twenties and the late

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:27.720
nineties, this obviously wasn't an option that was available to me at the time, but I can see that

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:35.980
absolutely this route could be the equivalent of that first book for many, where if the app is successful

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:42.120
enough that it's a worthy component of their portfolio, they don't have to retire on the app.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:48.860
The app could be the basis on which they become a freelancer. So again, it wouldn't be something that

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:53.560
was available to me when I was starting out as an option, but I think it could be the equivalent of

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:58.900
that. I mean, if someone is more excited about a startup option than they are about writing a

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:02.640
technical book, I mean, if the notion of reading a technical book leaves them cold, and I'm sure for

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:08.160
some people it does, you know, if this is what they're passionate about, it can absolutely be the

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:13.580
same credibility builder that a book would be because that's what you need. I mean, there's no

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:19.800
question that the only reason I get paid to speak, whether it be a keynote or a conference workshop

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:24.800
with regularity, it's not enough to be my whole year, but I've never pursued it to be enough. But

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:29.600
on the days that I'm doing that, I'm making good money those weeks that I'm focused on that.

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:35.480
There is no question that the reason I can do that is the books. So everybody needs a credibility

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:38.320
builder and apps and startups could be that.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:43.880
For sure. Let me lay out another path. I think this, there's a lot of cool ML stuff and predictive

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:48.160
stuff that I think that if you could bring enough data together and you could predict the outcome in

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:54.080
some market or in some area better than anyone else, you can sell it. I'm pretty sure that you could find

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:59.060
a way to sell that to companies that want that prediction to be made. And they're already asking their

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:03.140
people to do it, but they're not doing a good enough job. And if you got specialty in an area,

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:08.760
chances are that area doesn't have this thing. That said, another interesting path I see,

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:16.120
especially in the Python space is popular, well-accepted open source library creates a

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:24.440
open source plus company. So examples of this are the Scrapey API for web scraping. Those guys went and

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:30.140
founded Scraping Hub, which is web scraping as a platform service, right? So they've got the

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:35.180
infrastructure and they've got the distributed, whatever, got all the databases and the caching.

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:39.500
And you can just say, I want to take that library that you wrote. It's open source, but I want to

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:43.220
have you run it because of all the challenges of getting blocked and whatnot. What's scraping?

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:51.020
Matthew Rocklin started along with Hugo Brown Anderson. They started Coiled, which is

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:55.980
Dask distributed Python computing as a service. So Dask is open source, free library.

00:46:56.580 --> 00:47:04.840
Coiled is the Dask as a service. We have Explosion AI, which is spaCy, the ML open source library,

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:11.560
but Explosion AI is like more tooling and labeling stuff on top of it as a paid service. So over and

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:18.420
over again, I'm seeing these companies that are founded by the lead person of some really popular

00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:24.360
open source library in a way that doesn't undermine the open source aspect of it, but builds on it and

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.380
says, you really love this. Well, here's what you can do with it. Now that's a pretty long runway

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:32.880
because you have to have a popular open source library, but having a popular open source library

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:37.940
is also something you can sell to your company and do as a side hustle pretty well. Because very rarely

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:42.200
are like, are you creating a library that does web scraping? We're going to have to fire you because

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:45.500
you're doing that in your spare time and it doesn't make sense. Like this is such a conflict of

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:50.140
interest. You just don't hear that very often. I mean, certain circumstances maybe, but it seems like

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:53.940
something you could do pretty easily. And if it's really successful, then you're ready to take that

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:59.820
step on top of that. I agree. Being a somewhat old school machine warning guy, one of the topics that

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:07.960
I'm incredibly passionate about is feature engineering. How can I add that little bit of spice to a model to

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:13.840
get it to take off? And as I was listening to you, I was reminded of the fairly recent Zillow competition.

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:19.360
And I guess there were three guys that end up ensembling their solutions. But what I remembered

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:24.620
was that one of them just concentrated on one component of the problem of the home value,

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:31.420
this one piece. And that was commuting distance, not distance like we're all flying to work in a

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:36.700
helicopter because most of us are not, you know, but dealing with public transportation and all those

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:41.740
variables. So he would take all these addresses and just try to crack the code on that. No one else

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:48.780
on his team did that. So I can totally see how if someone just focused upon addressing one small

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:55.540
piece of the puzzle, building upon available open source tools, that one, again, that's credibility

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:58.520
building, but also I agree with you that it could also be marketable.

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:02.740
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. That's an interesting challenge because it's not distance. It's not

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:07.740
even following the map distance. It's like time. Time is the thing you actually care about and commute,

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:12.420
not actual distance, which is not so easy. Exactly. That's what impressed me too. Yeah.

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:17.160
Yeah. As somebody who has been working from home for a long time, I'm very happy. I don't have to

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:22.320
think about that. All right. Let's talk about some other areas. You mentioned the Zillow thing.

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:28.220
There are some competitions for data scientists that I think have monetary payoffs, right? I think Kaggle

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:31.940
has some monetary payoffs and some other ones as well. What about that?

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:36.780
Yeah. Well, again, there's always, I think if you shoot for the credibility and you get the

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:42.280
credibility and the money, it's kind of like one leads to the other. So Kaggle is an interesting case

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:49.520
because there's the big prizes, but H2O.ai, open source company that a number of folks are probably

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:55.620
familiar with, they have an advisory board that they've assembled of a bunch of Kaggle grandmasters.

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:59.860
And it's really something because you go to the conference and there's about 15 of these folks up on

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:04.320
stage. But the other way that they're using them isn't just to parade them around during the

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:08.160
conference, which is for me, I'll apologize to them. It's slightly humorous to have this.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:12.640
It's almost feels like, you know, they all like march out and you got 15 people on a panel. It's

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:17.320
somewhat of a little bit crazy because how can you have 15 people on a panel? But the other way that

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:24.620
they utilize them is they ask these folks, what would you do in the context of their auto ML product

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:29.340
development, trying to imitate using them almost like you would develop an expert system

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:35.200
to build models. So what's occurred to me is that you can come in and the top hundred,

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:41.280
even probably in the top thousand and some of these Kaggle competition, and you have bragging rights,

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:46.460
even if you don't win the big prize. And even if you don't win the big prize, there could be,

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:50.480
because I'm sure these advisory boards are paid. I have no doubt if they're flying around

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:54.680
to appear at a conference and stuff. They're getting paid to be on that. So you might be

00:50:54.680 --> 00:51:00.640
reached out to for advice. In other words, that's what paid advice. That's all that what consulting is

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.660
because you did well in a competition, even if you didn't win.

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:09.500
Yeah. Very interesting. I agree. One of the areas I feel like making sure winning scoring high in a

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:14.500
Kaggle competition is quite challenging. Creating an open source project and then founding the

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:20.360
successful open source commercial business on top of that is quite a big step in a long runway.

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:25.760
Something that's much shorter that people could get started with sooner would be mentoring.

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:31.300
I feel like mentoring is a low-grade consulting, right? You don't have to come in and say,

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:36.200
do your Fortune 500 company? I have this expertise better than your employees and all that. This way,

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:40.320
usually I get messages like this all the time. Hey, Michael, I'm really trying to do this thing.

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:45.340
I'm a little bit stuck. I've been here for a while. It's frustrating. Can you help me? And I almost

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:51.160
always have to say, no, I can't because I'm so busy doing all my other stuff. But there are places

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:58.140
you can go where you can spend an afternoon helping somebody get paid for that and sort of develop that

00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:06.900
experience of more corporate consulting type of model. Yeah, definitely. And there are a lot of folks,

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:15.560
including quite a few in their 20s that have done YouTube channels or various things on the side.

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:24.140
And I increasingly see that you'll encounter somebody like that and they'll have these calendar

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:29.360
links. There's tons of apps where you can do a calendar. And they'll basically just say,

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:31.300
if you have a question, pick a time. Yeah.

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:36.260
A hundred bucks an hour on up kind of a thing. And that's definitely an interesting way to do it.

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:43.060
So I would think that if somebody was starting with zero reputation and they used one of these

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:48.360
sites, Upwork or what have you, and people complain about the rates and that it's not like a great deal.

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:54.080
But if you did that for six months and tolerated the fact that you were getting paid,

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:59.760
maybe not great, but getting better at it, I don't think it's a huge leap to go from that

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:07.320
to part-time Python help desk in the evenings or in the weekends for another six months or a year.

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:11.340
Now you're making a good hourly. You're just not doing a lot of it. And then next thing you know,

00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:16.140
you have a mailing list. Next thing you know, you have LinkedIn followers. And there are folks that

00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:17.260
do that kind of thing full-time.

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:20.860
Yeah, absolutely. The YouTube thing is interesting. Let's come back to that.

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:26.040
For mentoring, I have not used it personally, but codementor.io seems like a pretty good

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.800
two-sided marketplace. You go there, say, I have expertise in this and I'm willing to other people

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:36.580
say, I need help in that. And it'll match you up. Hired and places like that are also pretty good at

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:42.520
making those connections for consulting setups. Upwork's interesting. So I hire some people through

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:47.240
Upwork and I've had really good experience for the most part. People I worked with,

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:52.280
for years through Upwork and it's been fantastic. I think the software development side of Upwork

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:59.100
is a bit of a mess. I'm not entirely sure. But a lot of times people ask me, how do you get started?

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:04.060
There's this chicken and egg. I'm only going to hire somebody who has experience, but if I'm new,

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:08.080
how do I get experience so I can get that job that requires experience? How do you make that?

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:12.160
How do you break that cycle? And to me, I feel like those places like Upwork actually have a really

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:17.640
good opportunity for you. Like you over there and if you get paid $15 an hour to build something,

00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:23.400
that's going to sound like it sucks. But if in one month you can say, my experience is I built that

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:28.440
thing over there and I can show that as part of my resume, all of a sudden you're no longer a

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:34.340
completely unknown bootcamp graduating data scientist. You're now a professional developer

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:37.160
with stuff published in production you can talk about. Right?

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:44.060
So I almost see that as an opportunity to get one of these, like an internship almost. You just got to

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:47.020
kind of, you know, it might not be the best experience and it might be it's not the right

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:51.000
way. But for people who are having a hard time, I feel like you can use places like Upwork to

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:57.060
like take a half step into professional development and then use that to take the next step and get going.

00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:04.180
I agree. I think you just have to, if I was, because again, my first related gig was teaching the

00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:09.460
software classes. So that's how I got my foot in the door. But if I was looking for a way to

00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:15.300
establish some credibility, I mean, getting paid something to build up a portfolio seems to me

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:21.800
better than unpaid unless the unpaid is a fabulous opportunity, which some intern unpaid internships

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:27.100
might be right. Yeah. So I think you just tolerate the fact that the pay is not great for six months

00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:31.860
because then you have a portfolio, but be looking for the on ramp for something better. But I don't

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:34.940
think it's crazy. I mean, there's a lot of negative feedback about it because, you know,

00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:41.260
the rates aren't great or they take too much. A lot of the feedback sounds not unlike what Lyft or Uber

00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:47.120
drivers would say is that the reality is once you take into account fees and deductions and everything

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:51.060
that you'll be disappointed with what you're left with. But I agree with your characterization,

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:57.080
which is you're building a portfolio. It should be quite short term. I can't imagine that somebody

00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:59.440
would want to do that for more than six months to a year.

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:05.020
But I do think it allows people to break that cycle of I have no clients, I have no experience,

00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:08.480
and I'm looking for that job where they say you need to have some experience in this. Like there's

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:13.360
a not just a thing I did on GitHub as my free time, but there's a professional thing in production I did.

00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:17.240
You don't have to say how you got the job. You don't have to say how much you were paid for it.

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:21.960
You just say, I worked as a professional data scientist for six months on that. Right. And okay,

00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:25.800
great. Looks like, you know, let's do it. Right. You're hired. So I think that's fantastic.

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:30.220
People should not discount that in my opinion. All right. Really, really quickly. Let's riff on

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:35.640
one final thing. And then I have a, an analogy for folks, I guess. What about teaching at like a

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:40.040
community college or part-time at a university or something along those lines?

00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:45.320
Well, I've been doing that now for about five years and I find it to be really, really valuable.

00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:52.420
I doubt that. I think this is more a mid-career option because obviously you have to have some

00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:59.820
credibility. Right. But yeah, I find that it just, it seems to be, I mean, I can really only go based

00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:04.100
on like body language or something like that, but it seems like when this comes up in conversation,

00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:09.980
there's a little bit of that. Wow. You do some teaching for them just seems to be kind of like

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:15.660
a cool thing. So I know there's a lot of demand for it. So you don't have to be the most famous person

00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:21.940
in the world and the topic that you're going to teach, but you do have to be mid-career. So again,

00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:28.400
it's where just one or two paid workshops at a conference, you've done one book and that one book

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:34.360
maybe sold 800 copies for a not so amazing publisher or whatever. Right. I mean, it doesn't have to be

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:39.060
amazing, but things like that taken in the aggregate, right. Would be enough to be able to teach

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:44.880
certainly a basic class or something because there's a lot of demand for it. And then you're

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:51.420
getting quite a bit of credibility associated with that. And data science is interesting because at least

00:57:51.420 --> 00:58:00.120
for the time being, you don't need a PhD because until recently there weren't PhDs in data science.

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:07.000
Exactly. So I only have a bachelor's. I don't even have a master's and I teach several courses

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:13.560
a year for UC Irvine in their certificate program. But again, it's based on my years of experience.

00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:17.780
You know, so I would say how many years would somebody need maybe five or eight or 10, but it

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:23.400
could be, it could be what separates, you know, in the mid-career phase, it could be what separates you

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:28.140
from getting accepted to give conference talks from time to time and getting a chance to do your

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:32.000
first keynote. I don't want to be overly dramatic about it, but that's the kind of thing that might

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.100
make a difference because a conference organizer might want to say, not just Keith's been doing

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:42.940
this for five years, but he's written X number of books, teaches for UC Irvine, has a LinkedIn

00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:46.520
learning class or whatever. So you never know what that first puzzle piece is going to be falling

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:51.460
into place. Yeah. But they all build off each other. Yeah. Definitely want to emphasize that

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:56.440
these things layer and that they're additive a lot of the times. You touched on YouTube just really

00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:00.500
quickly, I guess. That's actually a really interesting thing as well. You could create a YouTube channel

00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:05.860
that basically does live coding of a bunch of stuff or does like a live code review. Let's walk through

00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:11.400
a popular open source libraries code. We'll do another, a different one every week like that. Those kinds

00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:16.940
of things could build credibility and build an audience, which once you have an audience, so many of these

00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:23.300
things become not just possible, but relatively easy. But having that audience is dramatically hard to get.

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:29.340
True. This is true. So I've been at this for many years. We've established that. But when I was starting

00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:34.180
out, of course, social media wasn't a thing, right? So it's not like I wasn't aware of it, not paying

00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:38.880
attention to it. But it's really when I started doing LinkedIn learning courses that I really started to

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:44.500
focus on that because my assumption is, I'm sure it's correct, that the more LinkedIn followers that I

00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:51.300
have, the more people will find the courses and vice versa. So I've been, this year in particular,

00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:56.000
since I have not been traveling with COVID-19 going on, I said, well, here it is. I've been

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.860
thrown into a situation as traumatic as COVID has been at times this year that it feels almost like

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:07.760
a sabbatical. This is the first time I bought this house in 94. And this is the first time in all those

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:12.700
years that I've been home for six months straight, I believe. Yeah. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. 85% travel for

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:16.820
20 years. So I said, okay, well, here it is. If we're going to be work from home, at least for the time

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:21.820
being, if not for quite a long time, then I'm going to focus on social media. So I've been learning how

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:27.800
to grow followers and all the various things that you do. But I have in my journey of figuring that out,

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:35.560
I've met folks half my age that have a hundred thousand followers because whereas I was busy doing

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:40.240
other things in the first few years of my career, that's one of the first things that they figured out

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:45.980
that they leveraged. So that in and of itself is a skill. And if someone's going to go that route,

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:51.100
there are ways to crack the code on that. And I've met people that have gotten that many followers in

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:57.460
two years. Yeah. Amazing. Okay. Let me leave you with an analogy that I'm fond of. You give me your

01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:04.220
impression on this. So all of these things being side hustles would be typically taken as a side project

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:09.380
while you maintain your regular job that you were then going to either just keep doing for additional

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:13.660
money, leverage and do a better job at some point, or you could quit and make it your full-time job

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:19.440
if it was super successful. Right. But at the moment, the side hustle part is on the side. So extra work,

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.680
right? So one of the analogies that I like to think of, because I went through this somewhat with my job,

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:31.100
I was working full-time at least in a pretty intense job, started the podcast, worked on it a bunch,

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:37.820
grew into another podcast. Now I have two podcasts and eventually quit that job and use that foundation

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:41.920
to start my online training course. Now we have authors, we have a bunch of courses and so on.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:47.240
Right. So, but for the first year of that, that was, let's do these two things at the same time.

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:51.500
And if the other one takes off, maybe I can put more energy into it. Right. I didn't really

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:57.000
necessarily know that I would, but it was fun and let's see where it goes. So my analogy is to do with

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.700
rocket launches. So when a rocket takes off, it's, you know, full power as it takes off,

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:06.060
it's going and going and going and it gets going faster and faster. It gets to just about a thousand

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:11.800
kilometers an hour and they have to like power down. I call it max Q where there's the maximum

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:17.000
aerodynamic pressure on the rocket as it goes through the sound barrier. So it's like under the

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.860
most pressure. And then eventually once it gets through that barrier, it's easy for it to go.

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:25.540
They just power it back up and it goes up to 18, 20,000 miles an hour or whatever. It just takes

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:30.400
off, right? It goes out into space. So I kind of think of the side hustles in this analogy of max

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:34.760
Q. Like at first it's going to get harder and harder and harder to do both of these things.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:39.000
And you're going to be pushing against the air or whatever. And it's just like,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000
ah, this is so frustrating. But at the same time, like if you can make it successful enough that it

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.600
could be your thing. And you can, like I said before, if you can do it in two hours,

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:52.120
what if you had 10 hours a day and all of your energy, not when you're tired at the end of the

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:57.140
day from eight to 10 PM, you could, if you're successful with two hours, you can definitely

01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:02.460
be successful with more time and energy. So think of it as max Q, right? You've got to like go through

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:08.140
this early stage, like extra hard journey of trying to juggle both things, but eventually it's going to

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:08.920
lead to something better.

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:13.680
I agree. I've never thought of it that way. That completely resonates with me. And I have a couple

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:21.360
of quick examples and response. If you just look at my year this year, okay, my last travel gig,

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:27.660
you know, this COVID-19 year here, 2020. So if my last travel gig was in March, that was chaotic

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:33.420
because of COVID-19, right? I get home and my coauthor, Jesus, and I had to work on the fourth

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:40.360
edition of one of our books. So while that was going on, I wasn't paying attention to other things as much

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:44.880
as I should, because you think fourth edition, aren't you just adding a paragraph here or there?

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:49.240
It's not really, you have to check all the code. You have to update things, things that used to work

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:52.920
in the software four years ago, now have a slightly different command or whatever, right? And anybody's

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:58.040
been through it will tell you. So we were talking about the layers earlier. When I was going through

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:04.340
that book revision, I wasn't seeking out new clients. I wasn't focused on social media. I wasn't

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:10.340
keeping up with my blog content. That was kind of stealing my extra bandwidth, right? But then that

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:15.640
was over. I came up for air and I recorded a new LinkedIn learning course. But while I was recording

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:21.420
that, I wasn't doing a lot of writing, right? And then more recently, I've been doing this focus on

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:26.060
increasing my followers on LinkedIn, because part of that is learning how to do it, posting every day

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:30.320
and so on. I couldn't have done all three of those things at the same time. If I'd been doing a book

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:34.620
revision, a new course and focusing on social media, it would have killed me. Just the context

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:38.020
switching alone. Yeah, you have to take turns because otherwise you're not going to get through

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:43.940
it. So if somebody has a full time job, it's great to have a half dozen ideas, but you'd better stagger

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:48.480
them or you're not going to make it. You're not going to make it through. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:52.900
All right, Keith, I think we're well over time, but it's been really fun. So let me just ask you the

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:56.640
final two questions and let you get out of here. Sure. All right. So if you're going to write some

01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:00.520
code, what editor do you use? Oh, I'm an RStudio fan.

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:05.040
Okay. Yeah, very cool. I've heard good things about RStudio. I've never done anything with it,

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:10.400
obviously doing almost all my stuff in Python. Very cool. And then notable data science package

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:14.120
out there, like a library that people could use that you think is really awesome that you want

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:19.940
to recommend that you enjoy working with. Well, I mentioned ggplot2. Yeah. I'm just a big fan.

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:23.800
Part of it, as you can imagine, is what are things that I incorporate into my courses,

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:29.340
whether they be UC Irvine and so on. And not only do I use ggplot2, I sometimes teach it. So I'm a

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:35.560
fan of that one. Right on. Also, I should mention like some of these ideas, 75% or so that we talked

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:40.820
about came out of your LinkedIn learning course called Side Hustles for Data Scientists. So I'll be

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:46.420
sure to link to that in the show notes as well. So final call to action, people are looking to explore

01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:51.360
something different, something more, maybe they don't get to work on exactly what they want to work and

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.120
they have this passion and want to do some kind of side hustle. What do you tell them?

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:59.240
Well, you know, I say to, you know, seek out the kinds of things that we've been talking about.

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:04.600
One that didn't come up that I think is a great one is try to find a way to be a technical reviewer

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:10.420
on a book. And then all you have to do is check out your library of technical books, author that you

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:15.860
admire, send them an email and ask them when they're doing their next edition and volunteer to help out.

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:19.400
Yeah. I'm sure they would appreciate it. Actually, it's a lot of work. Awesome.

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:23.820
Yeah. It's hard to find a good technical reviewer and it's not crazy money, but it usually is paid.

01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:28.780
But hey, that's a great credibility builder. Not only that, it's a fantastic way of networking with

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:33.760
someone that is probably pretty well known. Yeah. All right. Lots of great advice. Thanks so much for

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:36.680
being on the show. I appreciate it. I enjoyed it. Yeah. Great. Me too. Bye.
