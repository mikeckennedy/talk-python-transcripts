00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.600
Do you run an open source project? Does it seem like you never have enough time to support it?

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.180
Have you considered starting one but are unsure if you can commit to it? The challenge is real.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.220
On this episode, we welcome back Philip Wu, who has been a solo maintainer of the very popular

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.700
PythonTutor.com project for over 10 years. He has some non-traditional advice to help

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.480
keep your sanity and keep your project going by holding down a busy full-time job.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.140
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 247, recorded December 10th, 2019.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.040
Philip, welcome back to Talk Python to Me.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.580
All right. I'm super excited to be here. I think it's my third time here, I believe.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.420
This, I do believe this is your third time here. The first time you came, we talked about the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.960
CPython source code and we spent a lot of time talking about coval.c. You had been doing a

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.260
graduate student course, walking them through the, basically the source code of Python to talk about

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.980
interpreters, right?

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.820
Yeah, yeah. That was back when I was at the University of Rochester. That was, that was back in the Python

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.980
2.7 days. And I've heard recently on your shows, there've been people who've done updated versions

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.880
for Python 3, right? Updated versions of this interpreter walk.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.240
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. We had Anthony Shaw not long ago. He wrote almost a book on it. So yeah,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.780
we had a lot of time, a good time talking about that. And the other one was really well received

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.280
as well. And it was something like geeking out in your golden years or something like that,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.300
like coming into programming, basically near retirement. You'd done some research on that,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.520
right?

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.120
Yeah. So that was right when I came to UC San Diego, which is where I'm working now. And that was a research

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.040
study actually done on my Python tutor platform, which we'll talk about a lot today. And it was a survey

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.920
I deployed to a bunch of programmers who were, you know, explicitly, we want to find people over 60

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.760
years old and kind of trying to find, you know, these people who are, you know, 60 and plus who are

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.580
learning programming and all sorts of settings. And we found all these really interesting things about

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.380
them. So check out that episode.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.500
Yeah, it was really surprising. And a lot of folks really enjoyed hearing it because I think they were

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.700
in that situation. And I think they felt kind of alone, or they felt like they were doing something

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.080
that was weird or was not going to work. And it turns out there's a bunch of people who

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.620
really appreciated getting into programming. One of the ones that touched me was the idea of I want

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.020
to get into programming so I can help my grandchild either do robotics or automate Minecraft or something

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.220
like that was a really interesting reason for it.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.640
Yeah, it was such a cool, you know, intergenerational thing too. So that was awesome.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.280
Yeah, yeah, for sure. So we're not going to talk about either of those things really today.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.680
We're going to talk about, as you mentioned, your project called Python Tutor at PythonTutor.com,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.080
right? Do I have the domain correct?

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.380
Yep, PythonTutor.com.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:21.800
So you like to mix it up and keep things a little bit different because I can go tutor myself on C++

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.280
at PythonTutor.com, right?

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.480
Yeah, so the name is quite outdated, right? It started as a Python only tool and then it expanded to a bunch

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.600
of languages of which, you know, C, C++, Java and JavaScript are the most, you know, the most widely

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.200
used. And I really need to think of a better name, but for now it's just PythonTutor.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.020
No, PythonTutor is fine. Yeah, keep the roots. It's kind of as if IPython notebooks didn't get renamed

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.720
to Jupyter, right?

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.880
That's right. Yes, that's right.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.900
It's something to that effect. So yeah, super cool. Let's, before we dive into the topics though,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.320
let's focus just for a moment on kind of what you do day to day. You've already told your story,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.140
how you got into programming in Python, but you said you're at the University of San Diego,

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.180
where I also was a grad student for a little while. So yeah, it's a beautiful place to be.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.480
And what do you do there?

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.440
Especially in the winter. Yeah. So I'm at UCSD or University of California, San Diego, and

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.920
I'm an assistant professor in the cognitive science department. So in our department, we actually,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.800
it's a very interdisciplinary program where we have people from all sorts of backgrounds who are

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.160
interested in studying the mind, studying how people interact with technology,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.700
studying, you know, building new technologies and such. It's a very kind of vibrant interdisciplinary

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.360
place. And my research and teaching interests are in a field called HCI or human computer interaction.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.780
So that's more widely known in industry as UX or user experience. So I teach a bunch of courses on web

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.120
development, user experience, design, basically how to develop products that are very user focused.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.120
And my research is on, you know, a topic that I think many of your listeners be interested in is

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.320
on, you know, how do you build new kinds of interactive technologies that teach people programming

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.240
and also increasingly now data science. So both of those are obviously super relevant to the,

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.780
to the talk Python audience.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.340
Yeah, absolutely. It sounds like super interesting research. And for a long time,

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.620
I worked at a scientific company that was spun out of a cognitive science lab. And there's just a ton

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.780
of interesting technology stuff going on there. You know, we were using eye tracking, like EYE,

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.680
not the letter I tracking to understand how people interacted with software and other things. And yeah,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.180
it's, it's a fun area to work, isn't it?

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.720
Yeah, it's really cool. I mean, I think we have, you know, in our cognitive science department,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.300
we have professors from all sorts of different backgrounds from like neuroscience to psychology

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.840
to linguistics to computer science, artificial intelligence, and, you know, emerging kind of

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.420
interdisciplinary fields. And it's, it's this nexus of a lot of like you mentioned of kind of people

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.980
and minds and technology all together in one place. So it's a, it's a really unique field to be in.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.960
Yeah, it's got a lot of kind of interdisciplinary cross pollination stuff more so than I don't know,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.780
I don't want to put any discipline on the spot, but you know, more so than maybe a lot of them,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.040
right?

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.100
Yeah, yeah, I think so. You're very diplomatic. Yeah. I mean, I originally was from a computer

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.540
science department, right? So my background, my degrees are in computer science. I was at the

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.240
University of Rochester in a computer science department, and that's much more, you know,

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.700
traditional single field, even though my work is clearly very interdisciplinary in education

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.700
and technology and UX and everything. So, you know, I feel, feel very at home in a very

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.760
interdisciplinary place.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.060
Nice. Yeah, I can imagine. Yeah, I doubt that a C-Python,

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.940
Python code walkthrough would really be a big hit in a cognitive science type of thing,

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.900
but certainly in the computer science world. All right, so let's talk about Python Tutor.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.100
Give us the quick picture. Like, what is this thing? I've actually been using it recently,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.200
and I'll share my experience with it. But let's start by just the elevator pitch. I'm driving in a

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.700
car. I should not be pulling up websites while I'm doing so. Tell us what it's like.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.440
All right, so if you're in your car, if you're in your Tesla, and you have your big touchscreen,

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.960
and while you're driving, you want to, you know, learn some code. So Python Tutor is a website. It's

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.640
basically like a very simple online IDE, a very simple IDE. So you just paste in code that you find

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.060
online, or you just type in code, very simple text box. And when you hit run, the really unique thing

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.720
about it is that it runs your code. It shows the output, just like many online coding environments do.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.320
But what's really unique is that it steps you through step by step what's going on. And at

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:29.480
every step, it draws diagrams of what's going on in memory. So what the stack frames are, what your

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.540
global variables are, what your local variables, what the pointers are, what the, you know, values

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:39.100
are and such. And it basically tries to emulate what a teacher would draw on the board, right? So you

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.100
had a teacher explain, what does this little bit of code do? They'll start drawing on the board,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.940
like here's some data, here's some variables, here's what they point to. And the Python Tutor tool

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:53.080
just tries to automatically render that, so that you could just either teach yourself, or you could

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.200
actually use that to show someone as an instructional tool.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:01.020
Yeah, it's really interesting. And it does, I feel like it addresses the situation where someone's

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.740
pretty new to programming, they're starting to think about, you know, what is a variable? What is a list?

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:11.200
What is a data structure? What is a reference type versus a value type? What is passed by reference?

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.980
What is passed by value? And all that kind of stuff that you need to start to at least just get a bit of an

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.520
intuition for if you're not necessarily doing a computer science degree, but you still need to

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.420
have a sense of this thing is actually shared by multiple variables. And if I interact with it from

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:31.440
either, it affects all of them, stuff like that. And so you can do really simple things like create a

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.380
list, and then assign it to multiple variables, and just very clearly show how that works.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.840
Yeah. And you know, the examples that we show, you know, the list aliasing is a great one, like,

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.880
you know, just always great to say code on the air, right? So it's, you know, say like x equals

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.960
bracket, you know, one comma two comma three, and then y equals x. So, you know, it's not clear exactly

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.740
what y equals x does, right? In some languages, it might actually call a copy constructor and make a

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.000
copy of the list one, two, three. But in Python, it happens that, you know, y equals x kind of,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.540
it copies the reference, right? So after you do that, then x and y both point to the same list of

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:10.960
one, two, three memory. But then if we asked you, you know, what does y.append4 do? And if I do y.append4,

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.840
what does x printout as? And if you see a diagram, you know, it's very clear that x will printout as

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.880
one, two, three, four, because there's only one list. But if you show people a bunch of code, you know,

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:25.320
x equals one, two, three, y equals x, y.append4, what does printx do? It's not at all obvious,

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.920
because people actually, you know, they've done these research studies, which are fascinating,

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.060
basically, which is, it's quite low tech, right? So you actually just give students a bunch of code,

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.280
like introduction program students, and you ask them to either draw out what they think is happening,

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.700
or just say what's happening. And people have all sorts of misconceptions, they think like

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.640
all sorts of different mental models, right? But the nice thing about showing the diagram is like,

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.580
there's one right mental model there. And once people get it, it's like night bright as day,

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.540
right? Like, oh, yeah, clearly x and y point to the same thing. And that's going to happen. So

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.640
the diagrams really go a long way into, you know, helping people learn these

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.200
fundamentals.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.660
Yeah, I think they really do. It's kind of the thing where it's hard to unsee it. Once you've

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:09.220
seen it, you can't unsee like, oh, well, obviously, this is what's happened in memory, here's the list.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:14.720
And then all the things in the list are other things that are pointed to by the list, and so on. But

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.840
when you're new, you don't really know. And I think it's even more challenging when you're doing

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.720
something like a class or an object, some complex thing that is, you could easily imagine,

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.680
like, if I have a dictionary, a bunch of dictionaries in a list, those dictionaries are

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.520
in the list, right? They're allocated as part of the list. But obviously, as you put it together,

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.260
you have the cool diagrams there. And I think that helps a lot. I also think it actually helps

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:43.500
understanding memory management a little bit, if you go and explore, right? Because Python's core

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.760
memory management story is reference counting.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.880
Yeah. And you know, it's interesting, because the tool is designed to keep the visualization simple,

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.440
you know, for beginners, but you can imagine augmenting it with, you know, if you want to

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.160
make a more advanced version, you know, maybe you put the ref counts next to everything, and you actually

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.160
see, you know, oh, if there's three pointers pointing, and the ref count is three, and maybe if there's like

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.200
a weak pointer, you know, or some other thing pointing, and this is not just for Python, for like C++

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.000
or something, you can see, oh, there's three real pointers and one weak pointer. So if, you know,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.800
if every real pointer goes away, the weak pointer is still there, it can still be garbage collected or

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.580
deallocated and stuff. So I think there's a lot of stuff there. And the thing you mentioned before,

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:22.740
just as brief aside of this, can't unsee it. So in the CS education literature, that's sometimes

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.040
called what's called a threshold concept. So a threshold is like, you know, it's like you've

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.180
crossed this for threshold, right? So they have some, I'm not super familiar with all of them that

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.100
they've identified, but like, there are certain things that like, they're called threshold concepts.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.480
So once you get it, like getting the concept of aliasing or something, you can't unsee it,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.500
you always will get it. But it's so hard for students to get to that point, unless someone really

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.520
shows you well.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.060
Oh, interesting. I didn't realize how formalized it was. Of course, it makes a lot of sense, right?

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:54.260
Because once you identify those, if you can get people over the gap, well, they're ready to just

00:11:54.260 --> 00:12:00.140
proceed, right? Just start understanding what data structures do or understanding how reference counting

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:05.680
works. But before that, it's kind of this weird, fuzzy world that you don't really understand even

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.720
what refers to what else. And so how do you understand how?

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.080
Exactly. And there's all, I mean, I don't personally do this kind of research, but I've read up on a lot of it.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.260
Just, you know, giving even small bits of code to beginners and just seeing what diagrams they draw.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.320
And this is very like cognitive science, right? It's very much like what mental models are you,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.140
mental representations are you building your head? And people have all sort, you know, they draw the arrows

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:30.220
backwards. They draw like boxes and other boxes. They draw like, you know, variables pointing to other

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:34.240
variables. And it's like, if you have the students explain to it, it all makes sense in their mind,

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.760
right? But like, because the thing with programming is it's all an artificial construct,

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.360
right? Like it's, you know, I think for people like us and your listeners who've been doing

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.300
programming for a while, it seems so natural to us, but it's all artificial, right? It's all just

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.240
made up a bunch of rules that are made up.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:53.740
Yeah. I mean, our boxes and our lines, those are conceptual ideas, but at least they, the concept

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.920
isn't incongruent with the way the computer works, but the computer doesn't actually care about these

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.100
concepts to the large degree, right? It just has pages of memory and numbers and whatnot.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.940
That's right. And I think that's another, you know, more rabbit holes that we might have time

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:11.040
to go down, but it's just, you know, what diagram should we draw, right? Like, should we draw the

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.280
bits of memory? Should we draw, you know, the quantum states of the atoms, right? And, you know,

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.720
obviously for Python, we want something a bit more abstract, right? And the whole point of abstraction

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.300
in these higher level languages, you don't have to worry about all the bits of memory. You just worry

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.340
about conceptual data structures and so.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:31.220
It's interesting. It's all about finding the best conceptual model that is both accurate, but not too low

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:35.140
level that you get lost in the details, but not too high level that you don't understand the important

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:39.760
parts, right? I think that programming and computer science, there's a lot of just having the right

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.600
mental model.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.600
Yeah. And from the machine side, it's the right abstractions, right? It's really like the

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.560
abstractions for your mind, right? And I'm sure, you know, because you teach a lot of these online

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.400
courses and you make your own materials and stuff, and we can talk about that, but like, I'm sure you

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.360
think a lot about, you know, in these domain specific things, if you're teaching async programming,

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.540
you know, what diagram should I draw, right? I don't know, you know, is it high level? Is it low level?

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:05.200
You know, what is enough of an abstraction so that people can actually understand it and do stuff

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.920
with it, but it's not too low level to get people confused?

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:13.120
Yeah. I think one of the challenges I see in teaching in general, also in like async, for example,

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.380
but in general is having the right levels. Often you want to have something that's easy to understand,

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:23.640
but if you give all the detail, it's just too much. If it's too easy, people go, oh, that's fake.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.420
That's not real. I need to actually understand what's going on. And so you've got to walk this

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:32.320
tight line. That's also in the applications you present, right? Do you present something

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.280
that's easily understandable, but not real? Or do you rebuild Instagram? And people are like,

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.280
what is all this, you know, caching? And what is this database thing? And like, I just want to know

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:47.140
a little bit about web development. So yeah, it's definitely interesting. I actually, for a course

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:51.340
I'm working on, have been really diving into pythontutor.com.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:58.520
Oh, cool. Yeah. So, so I'm working on a course called Python for absolute beginners or Python for

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.300
the absolute beginner. So it's kind of like what I'm hoping to be is a first year computer science

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:08.280
course for people who don't think they want computer science. What I mean is like, take away all the

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:13.720
abstract sort of theoretical stuff and just talk enough about data structures and pointers to

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:19.140
understand like the shared list concept and whatnot. And it turns out Python tutor is really good for

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.220
creating those pictures. I was thinking about how do I draw them? Maybe I could hook up my iPad with

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.940
my Apple pencil and I could do some stuff or I could obviously make some graphics, but it's really nice

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:33.680
to just walk people through, you know, let's throw this into pythontutor.com and see what, what it does.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:38.460
Let's just step through it. And the other thing I think is interesting is it's not like you just drop

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:44.120
code in there and say, run this and out pops the resulting in memory structures and values and so on.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:49.620
But you can step line by line and see how the pointers and the data structures evolve and you can

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.600
even step backwards.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:58.280
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Tidelift. Tidelift is the first managed open source

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:03.660
subscription, giving you commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:09.060
to build your applications. And with Tidelift, you not only get more dependable software, but you pay the

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.740
maintainers of the exact packages you're using, which means your software will keep getting better.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:19.460
The Tidelift subscription covers millions of open source projects across Python, JavaScript, Java, PHP,

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:25.100
Ruby, .NET, and more. And the subscription includes security updates, licensing, verification,

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:31.160
indemnification, maintenance and code improvements, package selection and version guidance, roadmap input,

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.580
and tooling and cloud integration. The bottom line is you get the capabilities you'd expect and

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:42.160
require from commercial software. But now for all the key open source software you depend upon,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.660
just visit talkpython.fm/Tidelift to get started today.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.260
A big part of this tool is that it's, you know, it's step by step. So let's say your code runs for 100

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:59.260
steps, and it brings you to UI that has a slider and a button, two buttons that goes forward and back, and you

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:04.940
can scrub back and forth to go forward and back on all the steps. And this works because all the code is already

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:10.180
run on the server, it runs all 100 steps. And the idea behind this tool is not meant for, you know, giant pieces of code.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:15.400
So the code doesn't run for that many steps, if it's just a few lines of code, and we can exhaustively run it and then

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.600
collect the in-memory trace at every one of those hundred or thousand whatever steps.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.900
And then we bring it back to the front end. And then every time you do a step, either forward or back, we just

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:30.360
render that in a visual form. So like you said, you know, people can go at their own pace and go back and forth and

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:35.200
try to see, oh, what just happened between this line and this line? Oh, why this thing do that? And, you know, hopefully

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.540
some people can figure out on their own, right, if they have some intuitions about it. But, you know,

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.920
even if they can't, then they can use this as a tool to show their friend and say, like, oh, can you

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.980
explain why this thing goes down? It doesn't copy it. And at least there's something to talk about rather

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:53.780
than just saying, my code doesn't work. Yeah, there's a lot of people just throwing code out onto

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:59.500
Stack Overflow or whatever, but you could permalink back into these examples, right? So you can actually

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:04.900
put it in there and you could say, you see this step five, this is where your conception has gone off the

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:10.240
rails. And my answer applies to that right there. See this picture, right? Yeah. And it's cool because,

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:15.080
you know, the nice thing about taking advantage of the web as a medium is that URL concept is so

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:21.520
powerful, right? So not only the code is embedded in the URL, the step number is as well. So if you're

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.720
at a diagram, you know, step 20 out of 50, and you see something funny, you can send someone a link.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:31.160
And then when it goes that link, it'll run the code and it'll step to the step 20. And then they can,

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.800
you know, you can ask them about that. So people have posted on Stack Overflow and on,

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.000
you know, discussion forums for like a MOOC, like an online course and stuff. They just like,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.820
here's a Python tutor link. Can you tell me what's going on here?

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:47.900
Yeah. And it's used in some textbooks and it's used in, like you said, some of the MOOCs,

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:51.920
massive online courses, whatever the MOOC stands for. I forgot.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:57.500
Yeah. The massive open online courses. Yeah. So it's used by a few techs. So like Brad Miller,

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:02.420
who was on your podcast pretty early on, who has this Runestone interactive and interactive Python

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:07.880
textbooks. Also it's used in UC Berkeley's introductory course, which is I think one of

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:14.000
the biggest intro programming courses and probably in the world, right? It's over 1500 students,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.240
a term, almost 2000. They can't even like fit in a lecture hall. They have to give several sessions.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.600
And it's, you know, because UC Berkeley is a giant school for computer science and all their

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.220
students have to take intro Python and they're using the Python tutor all throughout their

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.800
course materials. And a bunch of other schools use it too, that I haven't even kept track of.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:36.840
Yeah. That's gotta be a pretty rewarding feeling to have that many folks using it and benefiting from it.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.560
Yeah. It's really nice. I mean, it's been, you know, we can talk about the organic growth and

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:46.260
everything, but you know, every day we have maybe, you know, over 10,000 probably active users a day.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:50.400
And it's just on a site. The other thing that is relatively new since the last time we talked was

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:55.220
this live help mode. So there's a public help queue. So if you just press, if you're, you know,

00:19:55.220 --> 00:20:00.100
brave enough to press a get help button, you actually put your, just your session on a help queue

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:04.940
and some, anybody on the site, whether they're like a tutor who are just hanging out on the site or just

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.860
another student who is just procrastinating or just, you know, stuck on their own problem,

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:13.780
they can click your name and you join a shared session. And it's as though you have like a screen

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:18.560
share in the browser and you can see each other's mice and you can walk through and write code

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.940
together and then also chat in a little chat box. So we have like a few dozen people a day

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:27.940
using this feature and like getting help from just absolute strangers around the world. And it's like,

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.540
it's basically like a, you know, a stack overflow like thing, except it's real time and it's,

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.460
it's private. So it's, you know, they're not, you know, shy about posting their questions and it's

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.600
private and it's chat based. And it's, that's been really successful.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.560
Yeah. That was really interesting. I did see that in when I was messing with trying to visualize

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.800
the code that I was trying to explain, I did see, you know, so-and-so from Argentina or a user from

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:55.500
Argentina is asking for help on Python. So-and-so from Germany is asking for help on C++ or whatever.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.360
And there's a little button that just says help them.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.500
Yeah. And you can just jump in and it's all very self, you know, it's all self-moderating,

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.680
right? It's all voluntary. If you don't like it, you can just leave. There's no, you know,

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.800
no private information being exchanged. It's very kind of lightweight and it's,

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.860
it's worked really well so far just because it's, you know, the community is still relatively

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:17.580
modestly sized, right? So that the people on the site are, they're usually pretty well behaved

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.960
because they're there because they're trying to learn or genuinely wanting to help each other.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.920
It really reminds me of, you know, the, the good parts of the internet in a sense, right?

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.660
Where people are actually, you know, helpful and friendly to each other.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.640
Yeah. That is actually really nice. There's not the permanent snarkiness, right? You just go there

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.740
to help people or whatever.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.760
Yeah. And there's no harm done. If you, if you can't help you say, sorry, you know,

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.380
good luck and someone else might jump in and stuff.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:43.980
Yeah, for sure. So you talked about some interesting things that it does. Maybe we

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:48.300
could just talk a little bit about that before we get into the history and just the maintaining of it.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:54.580
So I have this Python code or this C++ code, and I want to put it onto your server and run it.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:22:00.180
That already seems a little interesting and risky. The other one is you've talked about it being

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:06.740
stateless. And yet there's all these interesting things. Like I can bookmark and share this code,

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:11.500
on step five with this visualization run, or I can have this interactive chat with these people

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.040
and so on. So how does that all work?

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.700
The blog post that I think you'll link to is about, you know, maintaining and scaling the system as just

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.960
one person, right? And we'll talk about that in later on the show. But one of the, I guess,

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.860
design principles or I guess inadvertent design principles is that I didn't want to have like

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:34.640
much permanent state at all. So, you know, for the most part, I call it stateless in the sense that

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:40.420
I guess the state is all explicit, right? So like if you visit the site, you know, for every URL you go to,

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.840
that state is completely in the URL. So if you go to the site, it's blank, it's blank code. You start

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:49.520
typing. And if you want to save your code, quote unquote, the only way to do that is to create a

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.660
URL and that your code is actually in the URL.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.980
Is it like base 64 encoded or something like that?

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.520
Yeah, something. Yeah. I don't think it's even compressed, but you can imagine compressing it.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.060
And yeah, it's probably base 64, some kind of encoded. It's all in the URL. And the thing is like

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.940
modern URLs are like, you can be up to, you know, a few megabytes and stuff. I mean,

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.960
it's not recommended, but you can fit a fair amount of code in there. And again, you know,

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.840
the tool isn't for a lot of code, right? So it's like, you know, a few lines of code.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:17.820
It's in the URL. And then also the status of, you know, do you want to execute this code? Which step

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.920
do you want to be on? What options do you have toggled? They're all just, you know, parameters

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.500
in the URL. So the nice thing about that is that I don't have a database, right? There's no database

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:32.000
anywhere. There's no user accounts. Like you don't register. You know, we don't keep track of your

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.100
history of your code. There's none of the, you know, the frills of like an online editor.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:41.220
Like what you mentioned about the chat is, of course, there is a chat server, right? There is a,

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:46.520
you need a chat server in order to maintain that. And I guess the chat server has in memory state,

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:51.980
but like that doesn't keep any on disk state, right? So like if my server gets rebooted or something

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.620
crashes, then at the worst that happens is your chat session dies. And then you hope to wait till the

00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:01.680
server auto reboots and then, you know, you reconnect and stuff. So it's very, very janky like that.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:05.560
Well, I think that's actually really interesting. It's all about the trade-offs, right? What do you

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.900
want to build? Are you trying to build a community around this thing? Are you trying to build a tool?

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:15.300
And one of the things we're going to dive into is this is something that you've grown quite a bit,

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:19.520
even though you have a full-time job and it's, you're not getting paid for it. And it's,

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.420
it's sort of focusing on one thing that you really wanted to build instead of just letting it grow and

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:28.800
grow, because there are so many knock-on effects from the stuff that you're talking about,

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:34.720
right? So once you have user accounts, well, now you have to have email because one of the very first

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:39.500
features of a website that gets used is I can't log in. I forgot my email. Click here to reset it. Like

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:44.540
within hours of launching my site, that thing got used right away, right? It means, you know,

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:49.880
as users were just signing up, that thing got used. And once you have email, you got to worry about

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:55.860
spam. And then you've got to worry about the American CanSpam Act. You've got accounts,

00:24:55.860 --> 00:25:01.300
and now you've got to worry about GDPR policies and all these, there's, it just, the tentacles of it

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:07.220
just grow like crazy, right? And then there's the support stuff that goes on and just, it's so easy to

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:12.520
ask for these simple things. And we haven't even talked about patching databases and migrations and

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.520
backups and those kinds of things, right? So, and it's fine if that's what you want to build,

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:20.900
go do it. You know, I went and built something kind of like that with my, my platform, but it's not

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.940
your main job or your main focus, right? Yeah. That's a great, yeah. As you were talking about

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:30.080
all those things, it just made me, you know, have all these, I don't have to worry about any of that.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:35.180
Either that or vicariously feeling, you know, cause you know, I, I know folks like yourself and I have

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.120
other friends who are building their own software businesses, essentially a software, you know,

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:43.520
their own SAS businesses. And of course, if you're building a business and you have users and not to

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.940
mention having money involved, right? You have payment processing.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:50.280
Oh, right. We haven't even talked about bank accounts and merchant accounts and all that

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.580
kind of stuff. That's a whole nother level.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:57.300
Yeah. And I like your framing of like, just from, you know, minute one of login, right? Like to say,

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:01.280
you know, let's say just let one have accounts from the minute people log in, people are going to forget

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.960
their password and then they need an email reset. And then you need to send out emails. So you need

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.380
to figure out how to not get on everyone's spam filters and like all these. And then if you keep any

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:13.620
user data, there's all these laws and you want to term the service and you want, and then we have

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:17.880
money involved and stuff. So yeah, so my goal with all this, I mean, this all started out as just like

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:23.080
a personal project in grad school, you know, many, almost 10 years ago. And like many, you know, I've,

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:28.020
I followed a lot of these independent creators and independent open source developers. And a lot of

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.880
these projects just start out like mine, right? There's someone's personal itch, you know, someone has a

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:37.080
personal interest, they start a project, it starts small, and then it organically grows. And then it just

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:41.580
depends on what people's goals are with it. And for myself, you know, I'm in a very traditional

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:47.100
academic role. You know, my day job is teaching and doing research and all the professorly things.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.620
And, you know, it just happens that I have this thing that I keep running. And it's been beneficial

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:57.020
to me both in terms of my research and teaching, obviously, and also just publicity and just, you

00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:01.620
know, general personal enrichment. But then on the other hand, I want to be very careful about scoping

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.700
it so that it doesn't, you know, take over my whole life.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:10.300
Yeah, absolutely. That's sort of the blessing and the curse of popular things, be it a free website

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.700
website or an open source project like SQLAlchemy or something like that. All of a sudden,

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:20.440
all these people are asking you to help add this feature or do this thing, or I can't get it to

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:25.260
work. Can you help me with this? And yeah, it can just overwhelm, overwhelm me, right? A lot of people

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:30.220
get burned out trying to deal with that. Not even to mention the folks who come along, ask for help,

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:36.520
which is clearly uninformed sort of foundations. And then they're angry if you won't take an hour out of

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.340
your day to help them.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.860
Right, right. Yeah, I think everyone has experiences of that. Yeah, I mean, everybody,

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:45.540
you know, we've seen a lot of blog posts and things on Twitter. And it's a very common, you know,

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:49.800
sentiment, you know, basically, I think if you've maintained any piece of software, whether it's

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:55.160
your own business, or it's a it's an open source one, you know, when you get thousands, hundreds of

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:59.700
thousands, millions of users, you know, even if 99% of the users are great, you know, that 1% or the

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.340
0.1% of bad interactions can just be really bad, just because kind of a large numbers thing,

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:09.120
right? And then those bad interactions really sour you, sour your mood for the whole day and such.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.040
So, right. And it's not just that there's only just a couple of them, right? There might just be

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:21.660
one a week, but the human psychology of it is we feel the negativity much more than we feel the either

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:26.980
explicit, hey, thanks, this thing really helped me, or even just the satisfied people using it and not

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:30.860
saying anything, right? But that negative stuff that sticks with you, and it can really drag you down.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:36.120
If you could somehow wash it away with the 10,000 other good experiences, you could drown it out. But

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.420
that's just not how people are.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:41.500
Yeah, yeah. And I think Brett Cannon has talked a lot about that. So, you know, Brett is one of the

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.560
core Python developers, and he's written some great blog posts, giving some great talks and interviews

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.180
about that concept and others as well, right? I mean, my article, my blog post links to a bunch of

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:54.480
prior work from other people talking about, you know, open source maintenance and burnout and

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:59.860
this sort of volunteer labor, right? And I learned a lot from reading a lot of this stuff through the

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:04.900
years, and I explicitly want to design this project so that I hopefully don't suffer from that, right?

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.920
Because, you know, that's not my full-time job to do open source.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.540
Right, right. And you want to have a healthy psychology and feel good about yourself and

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:17.780
not just feel beat up all day. That's great. So, in terms of the history of Python Tutor,

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:21.560
basically, this is something that you created in grad school, right? And it's just,

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:27.800
it's taken off, it kind of rode the wave of MOOCs and online education and interactive books and all

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.640
that. And since then, you've mostly been able to just sort of keep the lights on and add a few

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.280
features, not spend tons of time on it. Is that pretty accurate?

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:40.800
Yeah. So, I think it started around 2010. And then the first few years, you know, I would say 2010 to

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:46.120
2013, those first three or so years were very active in development, right? Both because I was still

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:51.280
in school, so I had much more free time. And then also the MOOCs, you know, the Mass Open Online

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:56.660
Courses, you know, MOOCs were coming online around the early 2010s Khan Academy. A lot of these paid

00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:02.300
online courses, right, on platforms like yours and other, a bunch of other, Linda and Pluralsight,

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:06.740
and all these platforms are coming on. Also, like Hour of Code and a lot of this, you know,

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:11.400
teaching everyone programming and kids getting into programming. So, there's just so much energy in the

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:16.760
first half of this decade around online tools for programming. And then a lot of, fortunately, a lot

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:21.620
of the intro courses were taught in Python. So, then I had this tool that had very good organic Google

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:25.940
searches. They call it Python Tutor. And as more people use it, more people found it, and they linked

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:31.280
to it from their blogs and from online courses and online textbooks and lecture notes and stuff. And it

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.840
just really grew. And then, like you said, in the last five years or so, it's mostly been in maintenance

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.860
mode because I've been, you know, very busy with my early professor career and such.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:45.760
Right. And that's a critical time in that career, for sure, to make it through to tenure and so on.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:53.120
This portion of Talk Python to me is sponsored by Clubhouse. Clubhouse is a fast and enjoyable project

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:58.380
management platform that breaks down silos and brings teams together to ship value, not features.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:03.640
Great teams choose Clubhouse because they get flexible workflows where they can easily customize workflow

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:09.480
states for teams or projects of any size. Advanced filtering, quickly filtering by project or team

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:14.400
to see how everything is progressing. Effective sprint planning, setting their weekly priorities

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.960
with iterations and then letting Clubhouse run the schedule. All the core features are completely

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:24.620
free for teams with up to 10 users. As Talk Python listeners, you'll get two free months on any paid

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:29.560
plan with unlimited users and access to the premium features. So get started today. Visit

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:58.760
So you have an interesting quote in the article that I'll link to that you talk about maintaining this as a solo open source developer and so on. You say that Python Tutor is probably, as far as you know, the most widely used piece of open source software that's maintained by a single active assistant professor. That's quite an interesting statistic. I think you may be right.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:11.140
Yeah. I mean, as far as I know, that's always good to say, as far as I know, because it's true. As far as I know, it's true. Yeah. So the quote there was about like, so an assistant professor, someone who's, you know, basically in the first five or six years of their career.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.920
Tenure track, but not yet tenured, right?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:35.660
Yeah. So tenure track means that, you know, I'm on a path to work toward getting tenure, but I'm not there yet. So, you know, you're basically at, you know, these big universities, a lot about publishing, getting grants, you know, writing research papers, you know, teaching well, all that stuff goes in your portfolio. And, you know, building open source software is not really part of that portfolio. Although there are people who do it because that's part of their research lab, right?

00:32:35.660 --> 00:33:03.720
So, and I guess my, you know, I guess somewhat claim to fame is I think out of people who are early in their careers, I don't know of anybody who's really been maintaining software has been so widely used. And there's, of course, software projects that are much more widely used. You know, the Jupyter project is a great example, right? So Jupyter notebooks and the whole Jupyter ecosystem that has started out of academia. And now there's a lot of industry partnerships, but that's, you know, a big team effort with a lot of funding with, you know, it's a big team effort. It's not just one person in there.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.640
In their home office hacking away late at night.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:12.740
Yeah, for sure. There's a bunch of folks that work on that. Another example that came to mind was SageMath. Are you familiar with SageMath?

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:13.260
Yes, yes.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:33.160
And William Stein's work? So yeah, he was at University of Washington near Seattle, and he worked on SageMath. I don't think he did it solo, but he actually left academics to just focus on SageMath and the platform. I interviewed him many years ago, and I hope, hopefully he's still doing well. But yeah, I mean, that's kind of the pressure, right? Is for him, he's like, I can't do both.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:37.700
I'm going to just go work on this project, which, you know, seems pretty interesting, but you got to balance it, right?

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:49.800
Yeah, it just depends on priorities, right? Yeah. So William is a bit, quite a bit more senior than I am. I mean, he's a, he made tenure and a full professor. So he advanced quite a bit in the ranks and University of Washington as the math professor.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:34:09.660
And all the meantime, you know, obviously his passion has been making the Sage project for computational mathematics. And that, you know, again, I think that started with him, right? Like many projects. And then it grew. And to the point where, you know, he wrote some great blog posts about this kind of over the years of how it's really hard to sustain this in academia, especially if it's growing, because that's not really your day job, right?

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:21.520
It's hard to get funding for it. It's hard to get students to work on it. But then, you know, he decided, at least as of, you know, a year or two ago, he decided to quit his professor job and full time just basically run his, run it as a business, right?

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:26.000
I think it's still open source, but there's, you know, a consultancy model and hosted and everything.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:43.060
Yeah, there's paid hosting cloud version as well. That's interesting. Have you considered you are subject to the publish or perish segment of your career, right? So have you considered publishing things about Python Tutor on, say, Joss, the journal for open source software or something like that?

00:34:43.060 --> 00:35:08.060
So far, actually, you know, this whole thing about Python Tutor in these past few years, it's not just, you know, for my own personal enrichment or benefit in the world. There was actually a great career benefit as well. So because the platform has a lot of users, I'm actually able to use it to do data analysis or to run experiments or to deploy these user surveys like for the older adults. So like, imagine like it's hard to reach thousands of older adults coding all around the world if you don't have a platform that you can just deploy.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:17.500
Especially beginner coders, right? Like the advanced ones, you can go through the standard dev channels, but right, Stack Overflow or whatever. Yeah, it's really hard to reach the beginners, though.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:37.840
Yeah, so I've actually been able to my students, I've actually been able to do a good amount of research on the platform. So we have a bunch of papers using the platform. But you're right, we haven't actually thought about writing technical papers about the system itself, per se. And part of it is just the lack of time and priorities. And, you know, the hope is in the future, if I have more time to think about these things,

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:49.860
I might transition that. But so far, you know, like you're saying, I've been down a much more traditional, you know, academic research route. So our papers are much more academic in nature, which is, you know, which is good, because I mean, I obviously like doing that, too.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:36:01.240
That's right. That's right. Yeah, it's the right fit. All right. So let's talk a little bit about your article. And you basically laid out the various steps and tradeoffs.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:11.860
I think tradeoffs is the under the key word or key underpinning here of how can you both keep this very popular thing going and yet focus on your academic career.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:20.600
And, you know, you have a ton of students right at UCSD that need to come to office hours and you need to grade their papers or their code and work with them.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:30.840
That already is, you know, draining. You probably don't want to go and then take care of a bunch of issues and bugs and stuff afterwards that you don't need to bring upon yourself. Right.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:40.880
So you kind of laid out some of the steps that you went through. And it's a little bit of a counter example of what people say you should do to be a really good open source maintainer.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:49.040
And it all comes back to where do you want this thing to lead you to? Do you want to create requests of a super popular library or do you want to create Jupyter?

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:54.420
Or do you want to keep this thing interesting and useful while not letting it consume your life? Right.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:37:03.340
Yeah. And I've definitely chosen, you know, sustainability as the most as the highest priority. Right. It's like I like this thing. It's running. It's running well. You know, it could sustain itself.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:13.260
But if I try to grow it in any way, really, you know, I feel like it's at a good equilibrium now. And if I try to do more stuff, it would just create more work. Right. Doing more stuff just creates more work and such.

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:33.380
So and I like your framing of it. It's kind of a counter example. I think the explicit framing of the article, which people can read, is that there's all these best practices that people talk about in open source, which I'm sure many people on your podcast have talked about, you know, building a community, being responsive to users, having good documentation, good tutorials, just inviting collaborators.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:51.600
That's right. You know, inviting collaborators, you know, maintaining a community, both of users and of contributors and such. And I basically try to turn every one of these best practices, you know, and think about the opposite. Right. Because my use case is that I don't want to grow this. I want this to keep going, but I don't want to, you know, grow it.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:38:08.520
I do think one of the key missing elements is or key assumptions is, of course, I want my open source project to be the most widely used and highest contributed to thing, period. Right. And that may be, but if it's not, then maybe that advice no longer applies.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:25.860
Yeah, I like that. I like the framing, actually. And that's, it's on a related note, this is kind of, you know, you read these blog posts about in the technology world, right? There's always more technologies coming about, you know, you can do Kubernetes and you can do all these crazy setups and you have all these new cloud engines and all platforms and stuff. And then, you know, there's these people like framework.

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:28.420
So you can use the new async stuff and all that, right?

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:54.880
Yeah. And then people are just like, all right, you can just chill because you're not running Facebook or Google or Twitter. You know, if you're just starting a minimal viable product or small business, something, just pick something that works. It's fine. Just build your product out. And, and I feel very similar, right? I don't use all the new technologies. I don't, you know, my tech stack is pretty old and pretty crufty, but it kind of works. And as long as it keeps working and it's reasonable, I don't want to like, I don't want to poke it at all because, you know, I don't want to have to deal with anything breaking.

00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:00.740
Right. Well, if you're trying to chase the most modern JavaScript front and framework, think how many times you'd rewrite that.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:01.460
Right. Exactly.

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:22.160
Right. It's, it's Angular. No, we're angry. We're angry at Angular now. So it's Vue. Oh, Vue went to three and people are upset about something there. So now it's React. It's just, it goes and goes and goes. Right. So pretty interesting. So let me just take you through some of the key points in the article that you talked about, some of the steps you've taken to help keep this balance that you talked about.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:27.040
The one that I think we've already hit on a lot is you hyper-focused on a single use case.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:43.780
Yeah. So the, the main use case, or I guess the only use case is, you know, emulating what a teacher would draw on the board. Right. So I felt like that focus is great because that gets rid of a lot of the scalability issues. Right. Cause you're like, Oh, I need to run arbitrary code. And like, how do you render, you know, a bunch of code and a bunch of diagram stuff.

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:53.820
And it's like, no, you know, the way to use this is think about what would a teacher draw on the board. If the teacher can't draw on the board, you probably can't understand anyways, because, you know, that's not for the use case.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:40:03.360
And also, you know, if you have too much code, if your code is too complex, you know, we just throw up our hands and, you know, we, we bring you to like an unsupportive features page and be like, all right, you know, this is really outside of the scope of this tool.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.680
So focus really helps, you know, the eliminating feature creep.

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:13.140
Right. We already talked about databases, email, reset passwords, accounts, GDPR, all that kind of stuff. Right.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:18.760
And just saying, look, we just need this really cool diagramming, this auto diagramming feature.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.280
This is what we're going to focus on. It's been really successful.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:26.900
And I think that leads pretty naturally into not listening to user requests, right?

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:40.060
People ask for accounts or social gamification or integration with GitHub or programmer, like autocomplete, like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code or an LMS, all these different things people are asking for, right?

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.720
Yeah. I mean, these are all great ideas.

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:45.820
If other people want to build them or if, if I had a team to build this, that'd be great.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:50.980
But again, it's just, you know, there's, if it's only me, there's no way to, you know, there's no way to implement all those.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:55.860
Yeah. They all do sound fun, but they all, it's one of those things where you want to ask,

00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:00.720
could you just make this small change and let's focus it down, not just from a whole application,

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:04.140
but let's just take it down to a little library, right? Some open source library you got.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:08.200
Could you just add this overload or this default value to this function?

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:11.720
Or could you just add one other function that does something slightly different?

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:15.480
It's probably only three lines to write. Please do that. Why won't you do that?

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:20.260
Well, because now I got to go write a bunch of tests and then I've got to go rewrite the documentation.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:24.100
And then there was that screenshot that showed the output, but now the output is different.

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.880
So I've got to go regenerate screenshots for all these things. And then I've got to rewrite the

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:33.580
tutorial because now this would be an alternative way. And there's just this three lines blows up into

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:38.540
a week long experience, right? It's as it's super hard to see those knock on effects.

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:42.360
Yeah. It's like, you could have this whole hour, just you talking to yourself. Cause I mean,

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:46.440
there's like, you basically said all these things way better than I could, right? Yeah.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:50.380
That's right. That, you know, these things just, just keep piling up. And,

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:54.360
I think that goes with the focus, right? Like if you're really focused on providing one thing and

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.720
an anecdote here is that, you know, I don't have any flexibility in how the diagrams are. I'm sure

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.980
you've run into this too. You're like, I really wish this diagram was drawn in a slightly different

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:05.320
way. And it's just like, the list go across and then stuff like behind.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.660
So it's just like, yeah, too bad. Right. Cause, cause you know, to make it more flexible,

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:13.700
it's just a lot more work. And in a way, you know, I kind of view this tool as because it's

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:17.560
kind of pretty stable. I just said, you know, if as an instructor, you want to work around it,

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.700
you just basically would explain it. It's like, oh, this is a tool, you know, it works,

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:25.080
but just be careful that, you know, this thing actually should point backwards or whatever.

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:29.980
And early on, I actually, I have a little anecdote here. I actually did work with a few professors

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:33.280
way in the early days, right? And I actually customized several versions,

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.780
some version they wanted the pointer drawn this way. And then I had a few versions for

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:40.440
different classes just because these are my friends and colleagues. Right. And also it was

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.040
early on. So I wanted to help them out. But after a while, I'm like, all right, there's no way I can

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:49.100
do this for everybody. Right. Like, so this is a canonical graphic, the visualization, take it or leave

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:54.560
it. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's fine. You know, if you need a better picture, use a whiteboard or

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:59.420
manually draw it yourself. Yeah. That's what I mean. Yeah. Draw it on either on a chalkboard,

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:03.020
a whiteboard, like some sort of digital equivalent, right? You could,

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:07.120
here's the picture I want to draw. And this is actually how it should look, right? I think that's

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:12.140
probably just fine. Yep. Nice. The other, the next one up in the article was that you

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:15.900
resist talking to users. Yeah. Yeah. That's a very,

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:21.360
very blunt way to put it. Yeah. So like, you know, in the early days, you know, it was great

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:26.120
because I had my email address on the site and it was very helpful to talk to users and get bug reports

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:30.400
and feature requests because that was how I was able to iterate on the tool so well. So I'm very grateful

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.500
for the early users. I mean, this is like, you know, even though I put it so bluntly,

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:37.620
I put an asterisk, I'm like in the beginning, it was awesome. But then after, again, after the tool

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:42.040
stabilized after a few years, there wasn't anything obvious I wanted to add. Then, you know, the bug

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:47.040
reports just were corner cases or things that have already been said before, or like, could you do this?

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:51.000
I'm like, no, you know, this is way too complicated. So then instead what I do is I have a very

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.200
comprehensive kind of FAQ slash unsupportive features page. And I list out basically anything

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.320
people would ask, it kind of listed out. And if people actually ask something that's unusual,

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:05.120
I would add it to the, you know, the FAQ. And that seems to work reasonably well.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:09.580
Yeah. That's really nice. Instead of just answering it privately over email, which is frustrating,

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:15.940
find a way to answer it in a public permanent form. So it can just stay. You could just either

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:20.940
just have an autoresponder that says, first, you need to look here, and then you can email me or

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:25.060
something like that, right? Yeah. And you're basically now where there's an error message on

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:29.060
the site for whatever reason, right? Either it's a user triggered error or just like the server went

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:33.260
down or something. I just put a little link to the page. They can just go read the page. Whereas

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:36.800
before I put my email address, so then obviously my email address, people would just email me a lot.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:41.000
So again, this is like the thing with design, right? Like if you want to create less work for

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.080
yourself, then, you know, make yourself less available. Right, right. Absolutely. So another

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:52.660
one that you decided to do is not to go and explicitly try to do marketing to promote the thing,

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:58.340
but more somehow you just sort of grew organically in the MOOC era and have been going strong since then.

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:02.680
Yeah. And like, you know, I'm a really big fan of following, you know, a lot of these open source

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:07.800
conferences, you know, PyCon and others and watching their videos and, and seeing how people,

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:12.440
you know, promote and market and spread the word about the open source project. But again,

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:17.840
it's just a time thing, right? It's like, I have to spend my time giving talks and traveling on much

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.940
more academic, you know, and research conferences and stuff. It's actually something I would love to do

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:26.600
in the future. You know, when I have a bit more kind of freedom and time to, I would love to explore

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:31.060
this world of non-academic conferences because I, cause you know, it's like I've been to many

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:34.740
academic conferences, all pretty similar, right? It's all the stereotypes that you hear about.

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:40.020
And I would love to participate in things like PyCon and, you know, OzCon and all these things,

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:43.620
but it's just, again, it's just a priority for me at this point that I haven't, you know, really

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:48.340
prioritized it. Sure. Yeah. Trade-offs. The other one that you mentioned that we have covered fairly

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:53.440
deeply is keeping everything stateless. Yeah. So just briefly on that is that I don't have,

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.480
basically I don't have a persistent database. Yeah. I guess by, by stateless, I'd be, there's

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:02.220
no persistent data store. Right, right, right. Right. Sure. There might be in memory chat logs

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:07.340
to sync that up, but that's not the same as I need to migrate Postgres to the latest version

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:11.960
or had a failure. So we had to go over to the backup cluster. Like that's not a problem you worry about.

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:16.040
Yeah. There's, there's none of that. I mean, basically it's, I have, you know, I just reboot the

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:20.700
servers periodically if something, it's pretty bad. I mean, it's like, there's some weird memory leak

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:23.960
issues because maybe with Docker, maybe with something else. I don't know. That's the point,

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:28.020
right? I don't actually know. I don't bother debugs. I just have some cron job that just

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:32.960
checks my memory usage. And if the memory usage starts spiking too high for too long, I just reboot

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:37.540
the server and it's all, you know, and I think I have a few servers. So it kind of, you know,

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:42.020
load balances. So like, it seems to work like pretty well. And at worst, you know, it's a free thing.

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:46.200
People will just go try again a minute later and it works. It's been holding up for a few years.

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:50.700
This is not a way to run, you know, DevOps or sysbit at all, but it works.

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:57.320
Yeah. No, look, practicality definitely beats the purity of absolutely. You're saying this as like,

00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:03.180
I'm just this guy. I got to just keep it working and I can't be debugging this weird Docker issue.

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:06.060
So you know what? Just forget it. We're just going to reboot it every now and then.

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:11.000
If you were a real company, you would definitely not do this. But on the other hand,

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.160
there's a really cool article from Instagram's engineering blog called dismissing Python garbage

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:21.700
collection at Instagram. And they, you can go import GC and say GC.disable in Python and it'll

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:25.820
turn off the generational garbage collector that catches the cycles. But because most of the stuff

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.880
is caught on reference counting, you can actually live for a long time. So they ended up doing that

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:34.720
in production and saving tons of memory usage because they got better memory sharing across like

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:39.200
the forked out processes. Yeah. Yeah. And then they just reboot it because eventually you got a bunch of

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:43.980
cycles. You got to get rid of it. So they just recycle the process. That's great. Yeah. So the

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:49.240
same thing, right? Like it's, it's not as crazy as it sounds, I guess. Yeah. And this is like,

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:53.280
that's great. That's, you know, that's an engineering hack in the, you know, in the truest sense of the

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:58.340
word, right? That it's like a simple and, you know, kludgy solution, but I'm sure it saves them all sorts

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:02.520
of time and money, you know, both the, you know, you can imagine calculating literally the savings of

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:06.860
money in the data centers from that efficiency and also the savings of money and paying engineers to

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:11.500
debug and maintain all that. You know, if they had implemented a more complicated custom memory

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:16.040
allocator scheme, it just takes all this money for highly paid engineers to maintain all that.

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:20.120
Right. It's like, no, we'll just reboot it. Yeah, exactly. It's, it's so weird that they get

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:25.040
actually better performance by just letting it leak memory, but apparently under the right use case,

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:30.240
they definitely do. So yeah, that's great. Yeah. Yeah. Another, maybe put two, a couple of things

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:34.980
together, like kind of in that bucket are that I'm not super worried about performance reliability

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:42.380
and not, we already mentioned, not super dedicated to staying up on the latest version of the hot new

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:47.460
web framework or whatever. Yeah. And actually, you know, the, the ironically, you know, me having a very

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:53.180
stable sort of setup is kind of good for reliability in a sense, because, you know, if I try to change

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:57.560
anything around, it might fail in some weird way. If I'm always upgrading the latest libraries or latest

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:01.600
framework, there might be some weird memory leak that's undiagnosed. Right. But if I stick with,

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:06.060
you know, super old, you know, sort of, you know, kind of a lamp stack, you know, super old setups,

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:10.420
those things are pretty, you know, patchy and those things are pretty well debugged and fairly stable.

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:14.540
But on the other hand, you know, I'm not trying to squeeze every ounce of performance out, right,

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:18.140
that it works well enough. Sometimes you have to wait a little longer if the server is busy or you have

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:23.920
to retry, but you know, this is not a, you know, wall street, you know, high speed trading or something.

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:29.860
Yeah. Maybe some, some large lecture is just finished. And, or they said, everybody open up

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:34.540
your laptop and try this. It's like all thousand of you go here now and try this. Maybe, maybe you run

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:39.520
into it. But my experience was it was super fast and it was totally fine. I had no latency issues. And I,

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:44.560
I think that's interesting because I feel like so much the trade-offs that we consider,

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:50.340
imagine a world where we're so successful that we can barely stand it. You know what I mean? Like,

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:57.440
there's, what if we're featured on the front page of Forbes or we're stuck to the top of hacker news for

00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:03.340
like three weeks or, you know, product hunt and just the people come and they just crush it.

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:08.460
I think people really don't appreciate a lot of people, not everyone. A lot of people don't

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:14.200
really appreciate how much traffic, just simple pyramid flash Django on a $10 server can handle. I

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:20.060
mean, my server, we get millions of requests. We do like 15 terabytes of data traffic exchange. It's

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:24.760
ridiculous. And it's like the CPU usage is 5%. You know, it's, it's nothing.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:28.140
Yeah. I think that, I mean, this goes back to the point earlier that we've mentioned, you know,

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:31.520
these blog posts about, you know, don't worry about designing for scale up front, right? This is,

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:35.900
I mean, it's a classic case, the modern instance of premature optimization, right? It's like,

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:40.000
you know, I think a lot of this premature optimization is, you know, as software developers,

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.920
you know, we often like to try on new technologies and try to, you know, they're intellectually

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:47.380
interesting, right? Like, Oh, if you can hook this up and this up, it's intellectually interesting.

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:52.220
And it's, I feel personally, it's sort of like procrastination from thinking about your product,

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:56.060
right? So it's like the hard thing when you're building either open source or a product or

00:50:56.060 --> 00:51:00.760
anything is the actual product and talking to users and the, the real core of what you really,

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:03.640
well, whether you're building something people really want, right? Because then you have to

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:08.460
actually talk to people and face criticism, but right. Documentation or tutorials or other boring

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:12.760
stuff in your mind. That's not like cutting edge. Yeah. Yeah. But if you just yak shave, I'm building

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:17.180
the best tech stack, then, you know, no one's going to tell you no, but then, you know, you might

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:21.200
over-engineer that. So for me, you know, it's not that I'm some, you know, engineering genius. It's just,

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:25.760
I didn't have time to do any of this. I just stuck with, I stuck with whatever stuff was available 10 years ago,

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.880
right? So that's another thing that people ask like, Oh, you know, do you use all these things?

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:33.320
Like they didn't exist 10 years ago. So of course I didn't use it. I haven't really upgraded at all.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:38.080
Yeah. Yeah. Super interesting. The other last two, I guess, kind of fit together as well as

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:43.200
the code is available on GitHub and I'll link to it, but you don't make it super easy for people to work

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:47.600
on and you don't have a lot of contributors. Yeah. Yeah. So this is kind of like the last part,

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:52.160
like, you know, when people talk about open source, another assumption that people have is that

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:56.760
open source projects have a community of both users and contributors, right? Like you think

00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:01.820
about these projects with contributors and, you know, GitHub pull requests and issues and all this

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:06.520
very vibrant thing of open source. And for me, it's like, it's open source in the strictest sense is

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:11.320
that the source code is open and there is a, you know, a open source valid open source license on the

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:15.880
code. So you can use it, you can put in your products, whatever you want, according to the licenses.

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:20.800
It's not quote unquote open source in that I don't foster a community contributor. So I don't,

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:26.160
I explicitly don't spend time on documenting the code or telling people really into the instructions

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:31.020
for how to install it or run on their own servers or under different edge cases and stuff. And also,

00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:36.840
I don't really solicit contributions, right? That anyone can fork the code and, you know, use it.

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:40.760
I'm sure people use it in all sorts of ways I don't even know. And that's the great part about it,

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.520
but I don't personally have time to, you know, merge the contributions and manage all of this

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:50.440
complexity around, you know, when you go from one developer myself to anybody who's more than one,

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.920
you're dealing with a team project you have to manage. And I just didn't want to deal with that.

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:57.260
Yeah. And it's another one of these knock on effects of, well, it would be great to have people

00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:02.120
to contribute, but then your code has to be a little bit higher quality so that it's easier for

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:06.180
them to do so. Oh, and then also you got to make sure that you have proper test coverage

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:11.700
completely across the board. Cause if they contribute something and the Travis CI automation

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:16.140
says it passes, well, is it really broken? Now you got to go test it. I mean, like here we are again,

00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:20.220
going down this rat hole, which if that's the direction, right? Like it's about where you want

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:23.920
to go. Like I said at the beginning, if that's the way you want to go, you definitely want to do that.

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:27.480
But if that's not the way you want to go, then maybe that's not the right thing.

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:32.560
Yeah, totally. And yeah, I think you summarize it really. It's funny because every one of these

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.480
points, you summarize the examples better than I could have.

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:39.940
Perfect. Well, I'm happy to do it. You wrote a good article that I read through and thought about,

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:45.580
I guess an interesting term that I've heard, I heard this from Scott Henselman first, but maybe he heard

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:50.740
it somewhere along the way. I don't know the original attribution, but I've heard of this type of project,

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:56.220
at least the way you described it at the end as source open instead of open source. It's like

00:53:56.220 --> 00:54:00.960
the source is there, but it's not sort of participating in the whole PR flow.

00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:06.180
That said, you do have people who have contributed, right? Like the Java run,

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:10.960
the Java visualizers was done by other people and so on. So it's not that nobody contributes. It's more

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:16.240
that you're not fostering it. So I think it probably counts as open source and maybe the little asterisk

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.240
like limited for special cases.

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:23.200
Yeah, it's very limited. And like the Java one is a great example because it was actually done by a

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:29.000
professor who taught in Java. So like funny to admit, I haven't done Java since I like the beginning of

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000
college in one class because I've just never worked in Java. I just never worked in Java.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.160
Let's go use something else.

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:38.720
Yeah. I mean, I just never happened. That just was never the world I worked in. I didn't work in,

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:45.320
you know, enterprise apps in the 2000s or widgets or applets or whatever. So he taught in Java and he

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:50.140
actually made a Java extension. He actually hosted it on his own site for a while. And then after a while,

00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:54.160
I actually merged his thing into the main thing because it was well-contained, right? It's self-contained.

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:58.560
It was its own thing. It just interfaces my visualizer and it works great. It works great.

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.560
But the thing is, if anyone reports a bug in it, I'm just like, I have no idea what to do,

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:04.560
you know, because this guy has moved on to something else too. But I like that.

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.060
Software is as is.

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:10.160
It's as is. It's literally as is. I don't actually know Java. I don't know how to debug it. You know,

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:13.980
it's running some old version of Java. It's, you know, it works and I don't want to touch it.

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:18.300
All right. Yeah. It's the version of Java from six years ago, but that's what it's going to be.

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:24.920
It's all good. Nice. So at the end of the article, you said it's a bit of a fluke that Python Tutor is

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:29.840
doing so well that you've, you know, all these millions of users who have visited it and benefit

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:34.880
from it and so on. And the reason it's a bit of a fluke is your day job doesn't incentivize it.

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.700
So let me ask you, what do you think? Do you think it should? I mean, I did mention the Journal

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:44.920
of Open Source Software as a way to kind of like shoehorn it in a tad. But what are your thoughts on

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:50.780
things like this and academics and should academics get credit for these kinds of creations? I mean,

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:55.080
it's clearly a value to the world if 10 million people are understanding code better through it.

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:59.420
Yeah, that's a great, that's a great question. I mean, that could be its own hour. And I obviously

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:03.760
get that question a lot. I mean, the question is really about currently academic path, you know,

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:08.940
kind of research studies and publications and grants, all the more traditional metrics are the main

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:14.280
thing. And, and I think that things are, you know, broadening out in some fields, right? And, you know,

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:19.200
in fields like my own and HCI, human computer interaction, user experience, a lot of our things

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:24.140
are open source products that you write papers on, you do studies on, it's all very symbiotic.

00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:29.520
I think my kind of most clear stance on this is that, you know, research is really about sharing

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:34.120
generalizable knowledge with the world, right? So like, an example is, if I made Python Tutor,

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:38.900
I just stuck the code on GitHub and said, here's the link, I think that by itself is not really any

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:43.040
much generalizable knowledge. It's just a bunch of stuff. But like you mentioned, if I wrote about

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:49.240
in detail, I showed how it works for users, if I have some general design ideas, you know, maybe these

00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:54.520
blog posts and these things, I think that there is a way to work that into a more scholarly sort of

00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:59.320
portfolio. And I see that in now that I'm in, you know, in a, in more disciplinary field, you know,

00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:03.480
we have colleagues in, you know, in visual arts, right? So in UC San Diego, we have a great visual arts

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:07.440
department, you know, what is their portfolio, right? Their portfolio is, yeah, they write some

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:12.240
papers, they write some scholarly works, analysis, history, but a lot of the portfolio is my art

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:17.320
pieces and my film piece. If you're a film professor or music professor, you're doing performances and

00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:22.080
stuff. So I think that the world of science is broadening out its definition more. And I,

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:28.060
I definitely do see that broadening in the future, but you know, universities and academia is a very kind

00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.760
of traditional and slow moving sort of institution.

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.540
It's a big shift to turn. Yeah, that's right.

00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:36.200
So for the time being, you know, I still think that, you know, like the ending of my

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:40.120
article, you know, I have a lot of students, especially, you know, very programming oriented

00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:43.020
students are like, Oh, you know, I want to be able to build software and stuff. And then I,

00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:46.980
I actually tell me what's your goal. If your goal is to be working in industry or working open source,

00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:50.560
that's great. But if your goal is still to build up a more traditional academic career,

00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:56.160
at least for the time being, the more traditional research and scientific studies are the way to go.

00:57:56.300 --> 00:58:01.180
And if you can do your science in a way that can foster open science and open source, which,

00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:04.140
you know, some people have done very well, you know, including some people we've interviewed,

00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:08.020
that's probably the most sustainable way, right? That you do your work in the open,

00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:12.880
but you also kind of adhere to more traditional scholarship as well. It's a lot of work, right?

00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:15.420
But it, you know, that that's the most practical way now.

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:20.460
Yeah, it does seem like it's shifting a little bit, but yeah, I definitely hear where you're

00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:24.680
coming from. I think some of the drivers are, Hey, we have this great paper about,

00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:29.180
we just took the first picture of black holes, but Oh, by the way, we can't actually take the

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:33.260
pictures. We have to use artificial intelligence to interpret a bunch of different things to actually

00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:40.240
compile the picture. And how can you possibly write your article without somehow talking about

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:44.860
what you built? There's probably a component that can be extracted out. I think as people are moving

00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:49.880
away from things like MATLAB and other proprietary, you know, SAS and whatever proprietary systems,

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:53.960
they're starting to get into open source and it just draws them into building stuff that helps do

00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:58.440
their research. And I think that that's eventually that's going to put enough pressure to turn the

00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:03.160
ship a little. Yeah, I think so. And I think that people at the more senior levels can be,

00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:08.340
can have more flexibility and in doing these sorts of things and advocating for that. And I think a lot

00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:12.540
of this stuff works on the top down too. I already we've seen, you know, then the top down view is,

00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:16.800
you know, if the funding agency, you know, if the funding agencies say that you must put your code

00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:21.440
open, your data open and stuff, and which some funding, you know, the NIH and NSF, they're starting

00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:24.720
to do that. I think those are great efforts because that at least gets people to think about, Oh, we

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:29.580
might need to like clean up our data and our code so that other people can use it. And eventually those,

00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:31.660
you know, the stuff will percolate downward.

00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:36.880
Yeah, I agree. And the reproducibility aspect that's becoming a bigger focus, it's always been

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:41.460
super important, but now it's easy to test whether it's reproducible. So, you know, I think that also

00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:43.900
leads to more of the code being open and whatnot.

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:44.960
Yeah, exactly.

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:49.580
All right. Well, this has been a super interesting conversation, but you've got to answer the two

00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:54.080
questions before you get out of here. So if you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you

00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:54.280
use?

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:59.360
I still use Vim because I learned it in, you know, in grad school and I still use it, even though,

00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:04.500
you know, everybody's on to Visual Studio Code by now. You know, again, just like with the old

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:09.560
technologies, right? I've passed several generations, right? There was, you know, Atom was big, Sublime

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:15.180
was big, and VS Code is now, you know, obviously really big. I still use Vim and that's just what I do.

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:19.500
We talk about these threshold concepts. There's probably some kind of theory about editors as well.

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:19.980
Yeah.

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:24.120
Well, interesting. And then notable PyPI package, something that

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:28.320
That's really funny. Yeah. I was trying to prepare for this, you know, last time I gave

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:32.560
this, you know, cop out answer, I'll just Anaconda or, you know, you know, just this package manager

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.480
and stuff. It's hilarious because I actually don't write a lot of Python code anymore, right? Because

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.720
you know, this Python tutor, it's all JavaScript, it's all web code.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:43.940
That's right, that you've got to write the front end stuff. Like that's where all the magic is.

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:44.520
And it's not.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.100
That's right. Yeah.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:49.020
Ironically, I'll plug one thing. I was actually scrambling because I knew you were going to ask that

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:53.120
question, Dan. I was scrambling to look at this Python kind of wrote for something else. This code that I

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.920
wrote to, you know, inventory my file system. So I've been basically, you know, doing a lot of stuff

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:04.440
with basically kind of building my own personal archiving and R syncing Dropbox and kind of thing.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:09.820
And one of the problems is how do you just crawl through a directory hierarchy super fast when you

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:15.040
have, you know, a million files. And I've actually found this is a plug for upgrading Python 3. I found

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:22.660
that this is not a package, but you know, the OS, the built in OS library, OS dot walk, and OS dot walk,

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:28.540
I believe is this thing that's only in Python, I think three, five or above. And it's super fast,

01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:32.820
at least on the Mac. And I think, you know, it's because it probably uses some system calls or stuff.

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:38.920
And it's notably because I had, you know, a Python 2.7 version before using a scanner or some other

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:45.360
thing, right? And like, if you upgrade to Python 3.3.5 and use this, this function, you know, OS walk,

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.760
it just goes like, it's just like thousands of times faster. And this is, you know, we people talk about

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:54.340
this a lot, right? And like, that's one of the things that gets people to upgrade is that, you know,

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:59.940
if, if something just is slow, and there's a new version of the API, and a lot of things in the new,

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:04.780
in new Python standard library, in the standard library, I guess, are either drop and replacements,

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:09.400
or a slightly different API, but it just goes so much faster. I just encourage people to look at

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.500
that. So this is not a PyPI packet. It's just really just...

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.960
No, that counts. Yeah, like a useful library.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.780
Yeah, just relooking at the standard library for, you know, things that they optimize. And,

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:22.740
and yeah, that was the first thing that came to my mind, because I was just working on that code.

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:28.160
Very nice. Very nice. All right, final call to action. People are either teachers or their students,

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:32.400
they're hearing about Python Tutor, they think it's maybe useful. What do you tell them?

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:38.620
I tell them that just go go try out the the site pythontutor.com. And to go participate in the

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:43.880
community of just, you know, helping each other out and, you know, asking for help and such. And it's

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:49.380
really community driven. So any help I can get on the site would be great. And also, if they want to

01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:53.080
integrate it when they're teaching materials and stuff. And you know, despite what I say in my article,

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:57.800
I actually really do like hearing from instructors and students in the piles of emails that I get.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:03.520
So I love hearing about how people are using it. So you know, if you have good user stories, or interesting

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:08.260
stories, I always write, you know, despite again, in my article, I say, Oh, I don't listen to users. But I actually

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:13.180
do listen to all the users, I actually write down all of their notes in the GitHub repo as notes of like,

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:17.440
these are cool future directions, I don't think I have time to do this. But these are awesome suggestions.

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:22.380
So I would just write that down. So it's once you get tenure, or you want to take you have a

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:26.580
sabbatical, and you want to come back and spend some time on it, you can actually harness all that

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:30.220
feedback. That's right. Yeah. I mean, that's just that's always a dream of like, Oh, someday I'll

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:34.000
get to make some of that. And then you just end up getting more busy over time. Because everyone

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.140
does. That's just the reality of life. That's how life is. All right, Philip, it's been great to chat

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:43.000
with you. As always. Thanks for being here. Awesome. Thank you so much, Michael. Thank you so much again.
