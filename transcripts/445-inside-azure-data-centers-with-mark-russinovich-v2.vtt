00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.840
When you run your code in the cloud, how much do you know about where it runs?

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.220
I mean, the hardware it runs on and the data center it runs in.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.440
There are just a couple of hyperscale cloud providers in the world.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.720
This episode is a unique chance to get a deep look inside one of them, Microsoft Azure.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:24.300
Azure is comprised of over 200 physical data centers with hundreds of thousands of servers in each one of those.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.420
A look at how code runs on them is fascinating.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.340
Our guide for this journey will be Mark Rusunovic.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.960
Mark is the CTO of Microsoft Azure and a technical fellow, Microsoft's senior most technical position.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.300
He's also a bit of a programming hero of mine.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.160
Even if you don't host your code in the cloud, I think you'll enjoy this conversation.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.320
Let's dive in.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:53.040
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 445, recorded on site at Microsoft Ignite in Seattle, November 16th, 2023.

Mark, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.400
Thanks.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.040
Thanks, Michael.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.680
Yeah, it's fantastic to have you here.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.680
I've been a fan of your work for a really long time.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.200
We're going to have a really cool look inside of Azure.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.520
And there's not very many hyperscale clouds in the world.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.260
You can probably count them on your hands, right?

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:45.740
And so I think as developers, Python developers generally, we'll be really interested to just kind of get a sense of when we run on the cloud, what exactly does that mean?

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.020
Because it's been a journey.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.000
Yeah, for sure.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.980
Before we dive into that, though, and some other cool things you're up to, tell people a bit about yourself.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.340
Sure.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.820
I'm a CTO and technical fellow at Microsoft, CTO of Azure.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.340
I've been in Azure since 2010.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.900
Prior to that, I was in Windows.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.920
I joined Microsoft in 2006 when it acquired my software company and my freeware website, Winternals and Sysinternals, respectively.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:16.200
And since 2010, I've effectively been in the same role the entire time, which is overseeing technical strategy and architecture for the Azure platform.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.800
And the skill of that is quite something.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.240
So it'll be great to get in that.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.940
That's awesome.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.100
You first came on my radar, probably in the late 90s, early aughts, through the Sysinternals thing, not through Microsoft.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.300
And you brought that up.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.200
So tell people a bit about Sysinternals.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.080
It was like if you wanted to see inside your what your app is doing on Windows, go to Sysinternals, right?

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.820
Tell us about that.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.340
Sysinternals grew out of my just love of understanding the way things work.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:55.340
And I was doing a lot of work on Windows internals actually in my PhD program where I was trying to figure out how to get operating systems to be able to save their state and then come back in case of a failure.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:06.860
So I learned the internals of Windows 3.1 and then Windows 95 and then Windows NT and started to think about cool ways that I could understand the way things worked underneath the hood.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:16.800
So actually, the first Sysinternals tool was something called Control to Cap, which swaps the caps lock and key, you know, the control key because I came from a Unix background.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.440
Who needs caps lock these days?

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.100
Yeah, exactly.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.720
No one should be that.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.500
Yeah, I'm not yelling at people very much.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.400
So the second tool that I wrote was actually called NTFS-DOS to bring NTFS to DOS.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:36.040
But the native Windows NT tools that Bryce Cogswell, who I met in grad school, and I co-wrote together were Regmon and Filemon.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.520
They were like the originals.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.540
And Regmon allowed you to watch registry activity, Filemon, file system activity.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.360
We later merged them into Process Monitor after we joined Microsoft.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.200
But we decided to make those tools available for free and available.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.520
So we started the ntinternals.com website, which then Microsoft's lawyer said, don't use NT.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.520
So we switched over to renaming it Sysinternals.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.640
And then Bryce was like, hey, some of the tools that we've made, we should sell.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:10.620
So we wrote a tool that would allow you to mount a dead NT system through a serial cable as if it was a local drive on the recovery system.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.980
And he said, if we make a read-write version, we should sell it.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:20.300
So he started, he went and set up a credit account, you know, credit card account on e-commerce.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.820
Authorized.net or something like that.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.140
It was like weird APIs.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.440
Yeah.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.980
And we started selling the software and we started selling the software and that grew into what became Winternals, a commercial software company.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.560
But Sysinternals and Winternals, like I said, were both acquired at the time.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.960
I joined Microsoft in 2006.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.080
But Bryce and I continued to work on Sysinternals.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.420
He worked on them until he retired from Microsoft and retired just in general four years later.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.960
And then I've continued.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:56.100
I have now a couple people, three people working on Sysinternals engineering system, keeping them healthy and the build pipelines working and then adding features to them.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.380
And I still code on them and still add features.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.040
Like just did a ZoomIt release a few days ago.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.880
I added some, I blur and highlight to ZoomIt.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.000
Yeah, people are doing presentations on Windows.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.780
With ZoomIt, you can say, let me quickly draw on the screen, not PowerPoint, but just whatever happens to be on your screen, which is really nice.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.620
I love my Macs these days, but boy, I wish ZoomIt existed on the Mac.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.100
Well, actually, people have asked for ZoomIt for Mac and I'd like to make a ZoomIt for Mac.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:30.600
And now with Copilot, I wonder how good it is at writing Mac apps because I don't want to spend all the time to learn how to write Mac apps just to write ZoomIt.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.200
But if Copilot can help, maybe it'll, you know, something that I can do in my, you know, you know, spare time.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.040
I don't know if it'll do it, but it'll get you close.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.360
It's crazy how these LLMs are writing code for us these days.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.800
And we're going to talk a bit about maybe how some of those run.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.140
Yeah.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.720
And so on.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.580
I mean, Azure is doing tons of stuff with large language models.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.500
And you all have some, you know, we're here at the Microsoft Ignite conference.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.820
You've got some big announcements.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:59.720
But yeah, I was such a fan still of Sysmon and I use that for all sorts of things still.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.700
So super cool.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.320
Now, before we jump in, I kind of want to talk about some of your big announcements.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.780
Yeah.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.000
Because they really caught me off guard here.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.540
I'm like, yes, this is exciting.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:15.400
But maybe since we're going to talk a decent amount about Azure, the internals of hardware, how our code runs, just give us a quick history of Azure.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.540
You know, when did this whole thing get started?

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.460
Azure started right as I joined Microsoft in 2006.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:29.300
There was a group of people, including Dave Cutler, one of the people that I've looked up to because Dave was the original architect behind the VMS operating system.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.980
And then Windows NT, which is now underlying Windows.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:37.380
He and some other people would just at the suggestion of Ray Ozzy.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.520
This is back when services was a big thing.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:48.180
And Ray sent a memo to the company kind of echoing Bill Gates' internet memo saying it's software and services now.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:55.220
And they said, how can we build a data center scale type platform to make it easier for Microsoft to develop services?

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.220
And so this was called Project Red Dog, which was incubating for a while.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:06.540
And then 2008, they publicly launched it because Steve said, we need to make this available to third parties as well as Windows Azure.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.800
And I'm sorry, 2008, they announced the preview of it.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.120
2010, it commercially launched publicly in February.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.660
And I joined in July.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:23.120
And a few years later, with the rise of open source software and so many enterprise customers wanting to have Linux, we rebranded it Microsoft Azure.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.660
And we also...

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.220
Can I run Linux on Windows Azure?

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.200
I don't know if that makes any sense.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:28.360
Yeah.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:36.880
And one of the first things I'd done, worked on with Corey Sanders was being asked, hey, we've got platform as a service.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.100
We have this thing called cloud services, this model for how you write apps.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:48.220
But our enterprise customers were saying, I can't move my existing IT stuff to Azure because it just needs VMs.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:53.700
And so the first thing we did was, hey, we should get IaaS capability in Azure.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.300
And so in 2012, we launched the preview of IaaS for Azure.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:02.500
And that's really when the business started to take off because enterprises then could, with minimal effort, start to move.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.920
Oh, well, that's like doing what we do in the...

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.100
Yeah.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.120
In their own data center.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.000
Our data center, but in your data center.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.420
Yeah.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.000
Yeah, exactly.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.360
Now no one even thinks about it.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.080
Exactly.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.440
So IaaS has continued to evolve.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.460
PaaS has continued to evolve.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.820
Cloud services was designed in a world without containers.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:22.060
Now we've got containerization, the rise of Kubernetes, and then application models on top of containers.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.300
And so Azure has evolved.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:29.480
And actually, I think, led some of that evolution of cloud native computing up into containers and abstractions.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.060
But it's been a long, long journey towards that.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:39.480
I mean, I think one of the things is I've always believed that ultimately cloud should be about making it easy for developers to say, here's what I want.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.120
And then the cloud takes care of the rest.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:47.020
And we're moving towards it relentlessly, that time when you'll really be able to do that.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.100
Yeah, so you don't have to know DevOps.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.100
You don't have to know distributed architectures.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.320
You just give you guys a good idea.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.740
Yeah, which is beautiful.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.160
It's beautiful.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.220
Now, real quickly, just give us a scale.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:04.760
Like, think of how many data centers, how many servers, how many miles, fiber.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.100
Yeah.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.460
It's kind of astonishing.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.700
It is pretty flabbergasting.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.740
And the numbers continue to grow exponentially.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:20.560
I'll just give you, because I remember when I first started in Azure, I was asked to give a talk at the Azure All Hands about architecture and some of the announcements we had coming.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:30.200
And the All Hands was two rooms with the partition removed in our on-campus conference center, meetings room, meeting center.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.100
We totaled about 500 people.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.680
That was all of the Azure team in 2010.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.340
And really, nobody outside the Azure team knew anything about Azure.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:38.760
Yeah.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.100
It was kind of a secret even inside, right?

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:41.580
Yeah.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:47.440
So effectively, that was like most, at least half the people in the world that knew anything about Azure was in those two rooms.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.700
And today, you know, Scott Guthrie's organization, Cloud and AI, all of it's working on Azure.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.940
And that's tens of thousands of people.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:11:04.560
So at least, you know, a good percentage, majority percentage even of the company is working directly on things that come under the Azure umbrella.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.920
So it's come a long way from that perspective.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.620
And you talked about physical scale.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:16.360
Back then, when we originally launched Azure in two regions, it was like 40,000 servers, like 20,000 in one, 20,000 in the other.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.100
That's still a lot of servers.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:17.340
Yeah.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.020
Yeah.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.940
But, you know, it was like, that is kind of cloud scale back then.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.500
Now we are at millions of servers.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:31.420
And when it comes to data centers, we've got 60 regions around the world, 60 plus regions.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:37.120
And each of those consists of one, in many cases, multiple data centers.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.000
And we're still building out.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.240
We're launching a data, like two data centers every week, I think is the number that we're launching.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:43.720
Wow.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.640
That's crazy.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.940
And these could be slotted into one of these regions or it could be.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.120
Yeah.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.540
A new region.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:48.860
Totally new.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.060
Yeah.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:49.260
Yeah.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:49.720
Uh-huh.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.440
Incredible.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:50.960
Incredible.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:50.960
Incredible.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.620
And so the big announcement that I wanted to ask you about, just before we run out of time,

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:59.520
and then we'll dive into some of that, that sort of how does your code run story is Azure Cobalt.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.100
Yeah.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.420
That's a new processor you guys announced.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:10.760
And, you know, listeners know, I'm a big fan of Apple Silicon and how it sort of changed the computing landscape for power and speed on like little laptops and stuff.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.620
And this is kind of that idea, but for the data center, right?

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.080
It is.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.620
Tell us about that.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.240
It is that idea.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:15.320
Yeah.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.160
I think having a processor that can be designed really with our specifications.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.340
If you take a look at Intel and AMD processors, they're fantastic processors.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.620
They're very versatile.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.860
They're taking requirements from lots of different sources.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.480
And so we're just, we're a voice.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.920
We're a significant voice when it comes to saying we'd like your processors to do these things.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:44.520
When we have our own, we've got the ability to just decide unilaterally what we'd like it to do based off of what we see and can vertically integrate it into our systems.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.480
We can put it on SSEs and integrate it with memory and GPUs.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:54.620
And so that is kind of the reason that we've done that verticalization for processors.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.840
That's not to say that the other processors aren't going to be significant.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.800
It's going to be probably a blend of these.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.360
It's going to be a blend.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.620
They'll have different capabilities that ours won't have.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:10.780
There are customers that want the specific features that they've got or performance speeds and feeds that they've got because they're not all going to look the same.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.320
And so I think it's just better optionality for everybody.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.160
Well, I can tell you as somebody who tries to run Linux on that thing.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:19.480
Yeah.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.500
It's hit and miss if there's even an ARM version available.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.060
Right.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.240
More often than not, there's not.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:30.320
And so there's certainly not going to be an insane rush to just let drop everything because there's a lot of code that's written for.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:30.720
Exactly.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:31.480
Yeah.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:31.760
Yeah.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.500
And optimized.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.660
That's the other thing too.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.100
Yeah.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.100
Yeah, for sure.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:39.340
But yeah, so on my list here of things I was going to ask you is, well, what about ARM in the data center?

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.360
Well, that is ARM.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.060
I know, exactly.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.520
I'm like, well, okay, so you guys beat me to the punch.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.240
Exactly.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:53.100
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Posit, the makers of Shiny, formerly RStudio, and especially Shiny for Python.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.020
Let me ask you a question.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.720
Are you building awesome things?

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.800
Of course you are.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.360
You're a developer or a data scientist.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.280
That's what we do.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.380

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.460
People ask me the same question all the time.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.620
Michael, I have some cool data science project or notebook that I built.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.900
How do I share it with my users, stakeholders, teammates?

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:23.700
Do I need to learn FastAPI or Flask or maybe Vue or React.js?

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.960
Hold on now.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.740
Those are cool technologies, and I'm sure you'd benefit from them, but maybe stay focused on the data project.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.220
Let Posit Connect handle that side of things.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.940

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.580
The link is in your podcast player show notes.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.820
Thank you to the team at Posit for supporting Talk Python.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:12.620
Awesome.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:23.580
Now, one of the things I wanted to kind of maybe have you go through for listeners that I think is just super interesting is sort of the evolution of the hardware where our code runs throughout the data center.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:31.300
So you talked about in some of your talks like the data center generations and what is that, like six or seven, eight maybe different variations.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.540
I'll kind of give you some prompts from them and all.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:43.520
But one of the things that I was thinking about when I was looking at this is, you know, do you have a bunch of small servers or do you have like, or do you partition up really large servers, right?

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.680
What's the right flow for that?

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:53.260
So one of the things that you've seen since the start of cloud, back when we launched Azure, there was one server type.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:53.640
Yeah.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:16:00.080
And we had different virtual machines offerings, but they were just all different sizes that could fit on that one server.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.120
It was a 32 core Dell Optron with, I think, 32 gig of RAM.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.320
Yeah.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.560
And so that was the server back then.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.920
What we've seen is more workloads come to the cloud that have different requirements.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.420
Some require large memory.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.640
Some require more compute.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.140
Some require GPUs.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.240
Some require InfiniBand backend networking for high performance computing.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:29.000
And so there's been a drastic diversification of the server hardware in Azure that's being offered and current at any one point in time.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.280
And I think you'll continue to see that.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.100
So the old, you know, it's just a pizza box.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.160
It's a low end commodity server.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.380
Kind of that's the cloud vision back in 2010.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.980
Now it's the cloud contains specialized servers for specific applications.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:51.780
And when it comes to large servers back in 2014, we started to introduce very large servers.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:57.580
The kind that, you know, people that were cloud purists back in 2010 would have been like, no, don't allow that.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.700
It's all about the cheap.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.320
It's all about the cheap and scale out.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:05.360
Is scale up servers for SAP workloads in memory database workloads.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:15.680
So we introduced a machine that we nicknamed Godzilla, which had 512 gig of RAM in 2014, which was like an astonishing number.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:24.540
And we've continued to, as SAP workloads have gotten bigger and bigger and more has migrated to the cloud, created bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger machines.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.360
In fact, I'm showing here at Ignite the latest generation of the SAP scale up machines that we're offering.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:38.380
It's not yet, they're not yet public, but I'm going to show a demo of them, of one of them call that I'm calling, nicknaming super mega Godzilla beast.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.080
Uh, because we've gone through so many iterations.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.500
So this, this one is super is the new, yeah.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.760
You're running low on adjectives here.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:53.820
And I don't know what I'll come up with next, but anyway, we're at super mega Godzilla beast as the current generation, which has 1790 cores.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:54.460
Wow.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:58.220
And 32 terabytes of RAM, 32 terabytes of RAM.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.000
Incredible.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:09.320
So do you do, things to like pin VMs to certain cores so that they get better cash hits and stuff like that rather than let it just kind of mosh around?

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:15.380
That's especially important with NUMA architectures where you've got memory that has different latencies to different sockets.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:23.160
As you want to have the VM that's using certain cores on a socket, have memory that is close to it, close to that socket.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:29.980
So that's, and that's just part of hyper V scheduling, is doing that kind of assignment, which we have under the hood.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:35.360
And again, it's like the control plane at the very top says launch a virtual machine of this size of this skew.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:41.800
Then there's a resource manager, the Azure allocator that goes and figures out this is the best server to put that on.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:47.440
It has enough space and will reduce minimize fragmentation and places it on there.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.920
And then hyper V underneath is saying, okay, these are the cores to assign it to.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:52.980
Here's the RAM to give it.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:53.460
Excellent.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.240
And how much of that can you ask for?

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.600
Uh, you can ask for the whole machine.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:01.260
You can, you can, you can, you can, for a full machine, you know, full, full server virtual machine

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:01.640
sizes.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.420
Wow.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.000
Okay.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.380
There's probably not too many of those in, but, but some people using them.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:06.820
Yeah.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.640
Like on the SAP ones, because they're designed for SAP.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:16.960
I think for those kinds of the current generations, I think we offer just two sizes, like either half of it or the whole, or the whole thing.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.520
Incredible.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.140
Wow.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:18.700
Okay.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.400
How, how much of a chunk of a rack does that take?

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.460
It's basically the whole rack.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:24.660
Yeah.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:25.920
Pretty much top to bottom.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.160
Yeah.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.700
It's like a 10 kilowatt server.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.240
Yeah.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.940
A little power plane on the side there.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:38.540
As you kind of talk through the history of sort of how your code ran, it was more, more colo, as you said, like the more smaller, smaller ones.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:49.400
And then as you got bigger and bigger on some of this, you started working on things like, well, how do we let the servers run hotter and have the air cool them rather than more actively cooled?

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:55.480
And then it even gets to a almost more, just remove big chunks of it and let them fail.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.640
And then when enough of it has failed, take them out.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.500
You want to kind of talk about some of that?

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.300
We're still, yeah, good question.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:07.840
Cause we're, we're still exploring this space towards higher efficiency, lower energy consumption, more sustainable.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:19.800
One of the experiments that came out of Microsoft research was project Natick, which is taking a bunch of servers, putting it in a rack of servers, putting it in a container that has nitrous oxide gas in it.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.380
So it's an inert gas and dropping it into the ocean floor and letting it be cooled ambiently through the water there.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.580
Not water on the inside, but the outside of the container.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:29.860
Yeah.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:30.900
So giant heat sink.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.980
And the, there was potential benefits of that.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.400
And it's still something that might get revived at some point.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:46.640
But what we've found coming out of that was if the parts are in an inert environment, they have one eighth the failure rates as ones that are in air environment.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.400
And with particulate matter and corrosive materials in the air.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:59.120
So we started exploring liquid cooling, both for that, as well as potential energy savings and more sustainable cooling and then air cooled.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.720
We've explored a two phase liquid immersion.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.160
We had a pilot running.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:09.520
There's some regulations that's changed around the, the kinds of fluids that have made us take a look at a different direction.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.180
So we use.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:14.940
Is that kind of like the core, the, the, what you would get in like an air conditioner or some of the stuff they'd replace?

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.340
They're called forever chemicals or materials.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:22.500
The ones we're using actually aren't, but the regulation is a little broad.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:32.560
And so we're just steering clear and it might be revisited at some point, but we're also have been exploring liquid cooling, kind of traditional liquid cooling, cold, cold plate called.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:42.320
And some people listening, probably like me are gamers and have liquid cooled GPUs or, or CPUs at home in their gaming rigs, which allow them to get overclocked.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.520
And it's the same thing we're doing in our data centers.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:22:02.860
In fact, one of the things Satya showed in the keynote was something called sidekick, which is a cabinet that allows us to take liquid cold plate, liquid cooling into an existing data center, air cooled data center, where the Maya 100 AI accelerators are in the cabinet sitting right next to it.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:09.240
And the cooling pipes are going into the Maya cabinet to cool the accelerators themselves.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.620
And so that is.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.600
So they manage like some big metal plate and then the metal plate is liquid cool.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:20.600
Yeah, it's effectively that there's a plate on top of the processor and then liquid is going through that.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:27.140
So I'm going to actually show pictures of the inside of the Maya system tomorrow in my AI innovation closing keynote.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:42.200
But that is, I think the takeaway here is that at the scale we're at and with the efficiency gains that you might get from even a few percentage, we're exploring everything at the same time, like single phase liquid immersion cooling, still exploring that.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.700
And then how to do cold plate more efficiently.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:56.020
I'll also be showing something called microfluidics we're exploring, which is much more efficient than just pure liquid cold plate, which cold plate is just putting the plate, like you just said, right on top of the processor.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.660
And so the water's taking the heat away.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:04.420
But if we can put the liquid right into the processor, like...

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.180
Are we talking channels in the processor?

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:07.740
Channels around the processor.

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:07.960
Okay.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.800
Just flow it right on top of it.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.440
And so that's something we're calling microfluidics.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.360
And I'll show that and talk a little bit about that tomorrow too.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.640
Offers much more efficient cooling.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.800
And it's not prime time yet, but looks incredibly promising.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.800
That looks awesome.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:30.040
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by the Pybytes Python Developer Mindset Program.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:35.180
It's run by my two friends and frequent guests, Bob Belderbos and Julian Sequeira.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:39.040
And instead of me telling you about it, let's hear them describe their program.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.420
Happy New Year.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.680
As we step into 2024, it's time to reflect.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.320
Think back to last year.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.760
What did you achieve with Python?

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:52.760
If you're feeling like you haven't made the progress you wanted and procrastination got the best of you, it's not too late.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.420
This year can be different.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.000

The link is in your podcast player show notes.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.740
Thanks to Pybytes for sponsoring the show.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:45.980
One of the things I saw in the opening keynote, I don't know if it fits into what you were just talking about or if it's also another thing where it actually had the whole motherboard submerged and then even just the entire computer is just underwater.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:51.840
So that was two-phase liquid immersion cooling, like I mentioned, is just dunking the whole thing in the dielectric fluid.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:58.720
And you had it boil at a low temperature, I guess, because the phase change is like an extremely energy-intense, aka heat exchange.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.640
Yeah, and it's actually two-phase because of the boiling.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:07.200
It phase changes into gas and then condenses again back into liquid.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.220
So that was the idea behind two phases.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:10.640
I see.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.440
Instead of just running a radiator, you almost condense it back somewhere else and then bring it back around?

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:15.820
Yeah.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:16.300
Okay.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.120
Wow, cool.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:22.820
So if we go and run our Python codes, whether it's PASS or IaaS or whatever, what's the chance?

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:28.460
It's hitting that or is this kind of cutting-edge stuff reserved for high-energy AI training?

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:32.240
Is it more like if we ask ChatGPT, it's liquid cooled?

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.820
Our standard data centers right now are air-cooled.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:36.760
So it's air-cooled servers.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.180
This Maya part is liquid cooled.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:44.660
So in our first summer, we've got some of our own workloads now starting to leverage Maya.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.320
Do you put on your own workloads first just in case?

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.680
Well, it's just to see it.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.400
It's just we're proving it out.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.040
Shake it out, yeah.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.720
Yeah, it's kind of piloting it, yeah.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.860
You're not offering that up to the big customers just right away.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.680
And so Maya, I don't know how many people know about this either.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:04.460
This is one of the GPU training systems you guys have.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:12.120
I mean, for those who don't know, OpenAI and ChatGPT run on Azure, which probably takes a couple of cores, a couple of GPUs to make happen.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:12.320
Yeah.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.520
I want to talk about that.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:21.300
Yeah. So right now our fleet, a large-scale AI supercomputing fleet is made up of NVIDIA parts.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:29.000
So the previous generation was, well, the original generation that we trained GPT-3 on with OpenAI was NVIDIA V100s.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.340
Then we introduced A100s, which is what GPT-4 was trained on.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:38.000
And these are graphics cards, like 4080s or something, but specifically for AI, right?

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:38.120
Yeah.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:38.480
Okay.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:38.740
That's right.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:47.120
And then the current generation of supercomputer we're building for OpenAI training, their next generation of their model, that's NVIDIA H100 GPUs.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.200
Then Maya is our own custom AI accelerator.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.220
So it's not a GPU.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:56.540
You know, one of the aspects of NVIDIA's parts has been their GPU base.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.820
So they also can do texture mapping, for example.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.260
But you don't need that if you're just doing pure AI workloads.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.400
So-

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.540
Back to that specialization, right?

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:05.780
Yeah, exactly.

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:09.300
Like, so if you could build it just for the one thing, maybe you'd build it slightly differently.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:09.660
That's right.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.160
Okay.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:18.980
So Maya is just designed purely for matrix operations used in, in fact, low-precision matrix operations used for AI training and inference.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:25.020
And so that is the specialized part that we've created called Maya 100, the first generation of that.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:35.160
Well, if I think of like some of the stuff presented at the opening keynote and stuff here, I think the word AI was said a record number of times, right?

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.240
Yeah, I don't think there was a topic there.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.060
Oh my goodness.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.020
I wasn't a part of.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.680
And so how much is this changing things for you guys?

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.580
Like 12 months ago or something, Chattapiti appeared on the scene and-

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:46.400
I mean, it's changing.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.600
It's literally changing everything.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.060
You know, Jensen was saying this is the biggest thing since the internet.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:52.580
Yeah.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:53.620
Jensen being the CEO of-

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:54.140
Jensen, yeah.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:54.680
Yeah, yeah.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.740
Who was on stage with Satya at the keynote.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.060
It is changing everything.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.680
It's changing not just the product offerings.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:11.180
So the way that we, you know, have integrate AI into the products using Copilot, it's changing the way we develop the products as well and the way that we run our systems inside already.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:16.800
So for example, incident management, we've got Copilot built, you know, our own Copilot internally built into that.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:22.600
So somebody that's responding to an issue in our production systems can say, okay, so what's going on?

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.280
What's the, what happened with this?

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:24.640
Yeah.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.460
Show me the graph of this.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:30.020
You know, just be able to use human language to get caught up in what's going on.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:30.400
Yeah.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.700
People tell me it's just statistics, just prediction.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.300
It doesn't feel like, it doesn't feel like prediction.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:41.360
At some, you know, the, the, the people that say that, I think are missing the scale of the statistics.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:46.100
And because we're probably predicting a little bit, like thinking about what are you going to say next?

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:46.480
Exactly.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.040
That's what we're, we're statistical.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:48.700
Yeah.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:49.140
Yeah.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:58.980
And so, so it's just, once you get statistics, that at a large enough scale that you start to see something that looks like what we call intelligence.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:28:59.520
Yeah.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.120
Yeah.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.300
It's, it's really incredible.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:09.980
Um, I'm starting to use it to just write my, get commit logs for me, you know, push a button and it says, oh, you added error handling to the background task.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.120
So in case this fails, you'll be more resilient and it'll keep running.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.920
I'm like, that's better than I could have got it.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.240
Just thought that might crash, you know?

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.560
And you just push the button and it's just, it's magic.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.120
It's magical.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:21.320
Yeah.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.080
It really is.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:28.520
I mean, it's not, it, it's called co-pilot for a reason because we're not at the point yet where you can just let it do what it does autonomously.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.960
You need to check its work.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.020
Like you need to look at it and say, oops, you know, that time it screwed it up.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:33.920
It didn't get it quite right.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.460
Or I need to add more context to this than it had, or extracted.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.980
So, but as far as accelerating work, it's just a game changer.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.240
Yeah, it really, really is.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:48.540
So before we run out of time, I want to ask you just a couple more things, a bit of a diversion.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:52.060
So Python, we saw Python appear in the keynote.

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.680
They were showing off, I can't remember who it wasn't.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.000
Satya was whoever followed him.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.840
They look, we want to show off our new sharing of the insanely large GPUs for machine learnings.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.120
Let's just pull up some Python and a Jupyter notebook and I'll just check that out.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.640
And you're like, wait, where are we again?

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.020
Really interesting.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.540
So, you know, you said you're using a little bit of Python yourself.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.180
Like what's Python look like in your world?

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.700
Well, so the reason that I'm using Python is I took a sabbatical this summer.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.720
And so I just, I was like, I'm going to do some AI research.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.160
So I got connected with an AI researcher.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.600
In fact, I'm going to talk about this at my keynote tomorrow.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.920
some of the work that came out of it.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.940
The obviously AI is completely Python at these days.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:29.140
Yeah.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:29.900
Almost entirely.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:30.140
Yeah.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:35.140
So I was, I spent the whole summer and I still am spending my time in Python,

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:39.220
Jupyter notebooks, and then Python scripts when you want to do some, some run for,

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.360
for final result.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.420
Um, so I hadn't used really Python before other than in passing.

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:45.320
I mean, it's a very language.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.720
It's very easy to pick up.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.000
Yeah.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.520
There's a, there's a t-shirt that says I learned Python.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.320
It was a good weekend.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:50.600
Yeah.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.980
It's a bit of a joke, but it's a good joke.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:52.160
Yeah.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:57.000
And I think that's what makes it so powerful is that it's so easy to pick up,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.380
but what's made it even easier for me to pick it up.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:04.660
I'll, I'd say that I'm a, my, I'm a mediocre Python programmer, but I'm using Copilot.

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.440
And that's made me an expert Python coder.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.960
How do I do this?

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.260
Yeah.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:13.700
And it's like, I've never, I don't go to stack over, you know, it's a question.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.240
I don't go for stack overflow for questions.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.780
I haven't had to get a book on Python.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:22.000
I basically just either ask Copilot explicitly, like,

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:26.760
how do I do this or write me this, or I put it in the function or in the comment and it

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.640
gets it done for me.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.760
And there's a, occasionally I'll have to go hand met, edit it and figure out what's going

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.100
on.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.180
But for the most part, it is writing almost all my code.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:39.100
And so my goal is how can I just not have it write everything for me?

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.880
So that has kind of become the way that I program in Python.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:48.260
And I think Python and AI and it, the knowledge of Copilot for Python, because open AI, obviously

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:55.400
for their own purposes has made GPT four and GPT three, five before it really know Python.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.040
I hadn't really thought of that connection, but of course they wanted to answer Python

00:31:59.040 --> 00:31:59.720
questions, I'm sure.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.140
For themselves.

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:00.460
Yeah.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:07.640
So I think when it comes to seeing what AI can do for programming, Python is at the forefront

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.180
of that.

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.740
What was your impression of it?

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.720
I mean, I'm sure you've probably seen it before, but like, what's your impression of working in

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:17.340
it coming from a curly brace semicolon type language like C++ or something?

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:22.260
Because they drop a bunch of parentheses, they have these tab space, these four spaces rules

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:22.660
and stuff.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.340
Well, it's, you know, the YAML versus Jason.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.240
It is kind of a debate, isn't it?

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.460
But I mean, I've gotten used to it.

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:31.480
It's not a, it's not a big deal.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.180
And I find it's, it's less verbose than C.

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.700
There's less typing.

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.000
Less symbol noise.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.140
You can just kind of get the essence.

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:39.420
Yeah.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:39.700
Yeah.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:40.160
Yeah.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.380
I kind of had that experience as well, coming from a C based language.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.600
I'm like, wow, this is really weird.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:47.500
And then after I went back to C#, I'm like, but this is also weird.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.660
And I kind of like the clarity over here.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.500
So now what do I do with life?

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.360
And then you go back and like semicolons are annoying now.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.140
Yes, exactly.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.380
I like, I thought they were needed.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:56.980
They're not needed.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:57.680
What's going on?

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.780
Another thing that I think, you know, maybe people really enjoy hearing a bit about, and

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:09.340
I'm a big fan of, you wrote a three part series of novels about computer hackers called Zero

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:09.560
Day.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.780
Really good.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:16.200
I read all of them back when they came out and so much of this like computer mystery stuff

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.060
is like, oh, they're using VB6.

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.060
I'm going to get their IP address.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:19.780
You're like, wait, what?

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.580
I mean, those words are meaningful, but the sense is not right.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:28.080
And you know, your books are like a lot of sort of spy stuff, but also a lot of really

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.940
cool, legit, reasonably possible computer stuff.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:32.100
Yeah.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.340
Tell people a quick bit about that if they want to catch up.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.940
I love cyber, I love thrillers growing up, techno thrillers.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:42.460
I read Dramatistrain when I was like in seventh grade and I was like, this book is so cool

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:48.040
because it's like, I'm learning science plus it's, you know, it's really exciting.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.740
So I've always wanted to write one.

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:56.760
And then coming into after, into the late 1990s, when you started to see some of these large

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:01.920
scale viruses, I was just thinking, this is such a powerful weapon for somebody to cause

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.380
destruction.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.500
And then 9-11 happened.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:09.540
I'm like, all right, logical next step is leveraging a cyber weapon to do something with the same

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:09.940
goals.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:16.460
And so that's what led me to write Zero Day, which is taking that idea of using a cyber

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.380
weapon for terrorism.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:20.160
Then I was like, oh, that book was really well received.

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.380
I had a lot of fun doing it.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:22.380
So let me write the next one.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:26.820
And I wanted to continue in this theme with the same characters, Daryl, Hagen and, and,

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.940
um, Jeff Akin and say, what, what's something else?

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:34.360
What's another cyber security angle that I can take a look at in the second one.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.580
So the second one was state sponsored, cyber espionage.

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:41.380
And I actually, the ironic thing is I'd already had Iran in the story.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:42.740
I'd already had China in the story.

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:46.480
I had people trying to figure out how to get Iran a nuclear weapon.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.820
And then Stuxnet happened right when I was still writing the book.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.960
And I'm like, okay, this is like a small part of my plot line.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.180
Yeah.

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:54.460
Line it up for you.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:57.460
So I had to change the book a little to acknowledge Stuxnet happening.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:01.440
And then the third one was about insider threats, which I think is one of the toughest

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.260
threats to deal with.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:07.660
In this case, it was a long range plot from some people that wanted to compromise,

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:12.640
stock exchange and kind of a mixture of high frequency trading and insider threat with

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.860
cybersecurity systems, was the third one called rogue code.

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:16.760
Yeah.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:17.780
So they were all really good.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:18.460
I really enjoyed it.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.960
Were you a fan of Mr. Robot?

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.040
Did you ever watch that series?

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:21.420
I did.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.080
I love that series.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:22.340
Yeah.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.220
Oh my gosh.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.380
Again, it's, it seemed pretty plausible.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:26.760
Yeah.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.580
I really liked that.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:30.780
Imagine a lot of people out there listening have seen, seen Mr. Robot as well.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.780
If they want, you know, that kind of idea, but in just a series, they can binge.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:35.220
Yeah.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:35.420
Cool.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:39.440
Maybe we should wrap up our, our chat here, but just a quick of like some of the future

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:44.980
things you talked about, like rapidly deploying some of these data centers and some of these

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.220
Ballard systems.

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:50.920
Maybe just give us a sense of like, even, like disaggregated rack architecture.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:57.060
Do you have, instead of having a GPU alongside a server, like a rack of GPUs and then optical

00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:58.840
connections to a rack of servers?

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.040
Like give us a sense of some of the stuff where it's going.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:01.400
Yeah.

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.340
So that's some of the stuff that we've exploring.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:08.100
Like I mentioned, we're taking a look at lots of different ways to re-architect the data

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.000
center to be more efficient.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.100
And one of the ways that you get efficient is by, and in reduced fragmentation is by having

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.320
larger pools to allocate resources from.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:20.500
If you think about allocating a virtual machine on a server, how much RAM can you give it at

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:20.880
most?

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.120
Well, as much as sitting on the server, how many GPUs can you attach to it?

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.580
Well, as most as are attached to that server.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:26.860
All right.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.800
How many PCI slots?

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:27.960
Yeah.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:28.440
Yeah.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:34.400
So, but if you think about, I've got a large resource pool, it's a whole group of GPUs

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.440
that I can be able to give it as many GPUs as 50.

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:37.860
Yeah.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:38.340
Ask for 50.

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.020
Ask for 50.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:39.300
Exactly.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:44.140
The benefits of pooling for resource allocation are that you reduce fragmentation and you

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:44.800
get more flexibility.

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:49.940
So we've been trying to explore how we can do this from rack scale disaggregation of saying

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:54.000
there's a whole bunch of SSDs at the top of the rack, then there's a bunch of GPUs, and

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.220
then there's a bunch of CPU cores.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.860
And let's just compose the system dynamically.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:02.340
There's a bunch of challenges from a resiliency perspective.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:07.380
Like how do you prevent one failure of the GPU part of the system, bringing down the whole

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:07.780
rack?

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:11.340
For example, there's latency and bandwidth challenges.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:15.420
Like how do you, when you're sitting there on the PCI bus, you get a whole bunch of bandwidth

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.760
and you get very low latency.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.460
If you're going across the rack, you might have the same bandwidth.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:24.640
You might have lower bandwidth just because you can't deliver that much bandwidth out of

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:25.680
the GPUs.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:25.820
Right.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:29.440
All the systems are optimized to make assumptions about these numbers.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:29.900
Exactly.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.640
And your latency is going to be higher.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.360
And so some workloads can't tolerate their latency.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.960
So we've been exploring disaggregated memory, disaggregated GPUs.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.220
I've shown demos of both of them.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.120
We're still exploring those.

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.580
We're not, you know, it's not ready for production.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:42.780
Yeah.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.820
Disaggregated memory or GPUs?

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:45.020
Yeah.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.020
I would guess memory, but I have a zero experience.

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:53.180
Memory is challenging because there are certain GPU workloads that aren't so latency sensitive,

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.400
like AI training.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:54.620
Sure.

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.920
Like a batch job sort of thing.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:57.460
Yeah.

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:02.360
But when it comes to memory, you almost always see the latency.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:07.480
And so what we think we can do is get remote memory down to NUMA, you know, speaking of

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.960
non-uniform memory architecture latency down to that level.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.560
And a lot of applications can tolerate that.

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.040
Okay.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:18.180
And so we have a memory tiering where you've got close memory that's on the system and then

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.680
remote memory, which is like NUMA latency.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.840
Kind of like a L2 cache, but like a bigger idea of it.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:23.860
Very, very cool.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.240
I think because you're doing such neat stuff.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:33.220
And when you see these hyperscale clouds, I think a lot of what people see is the insane

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.580
dashboard of choices.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:35.520
Like, do I do?

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:35.920
Yeah.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:36.780
Do I do routing?

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:37.780
Do I do firewalls?

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.640
Do I do VPCs?

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.280
Do I do like paths?

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.360
I ask, what do I do?

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.600
But oftentimes I don't really think about like, well, you're getting a slice of this giant

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:50.600
server and, you know, maybe someday it'll live under the ocean or whatever.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:50.880
Right.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:51.800
So it was really cool to.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.120
Yeah.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:56.100
And I think what you're seeing is the cloud, it started with a few basic building blocks.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:01.180
And then we started to explore lots of different directions of creating lots of different paths

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:05.080
services and paths services for compute and then different data offerings.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:09.080
I think the space, and again, coming to the workload, you get this.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.620
Is it high?

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:11.960
Do you need key value store?

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.440
Do you need a vectorized database?

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:18.100
Do you need, and do you need any of those to be extreme performance?

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:23.740
Because then if you need extreme performance, go for the design for purpose vectorized database.

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:30.140
If you want key value with vectorization, but it's okay if the vectorization isn't the fastest

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.960
possible, you know, you can go use this other offering.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:39.380
So that's why the list of options has continued to expand is just because every workload says,

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:40.100
I need this.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:41.600
And that's the most important thing to me.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.000
And the other one says, no, I need this.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:43.980
That's the most important thing.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.280
And others are like, I don't care.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:49.460
Well, as it becomes the mainframe of the world, right?

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.260
There's a lot of different types of apps running on it.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:51.520
Yeah.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.020
Yeah.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:52.760
Awesome.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.600
All right, Mark.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.400
Final call to action.

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:58.000
People maybe want to learn more about some of the stuff we saw here, see some pictures,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.960
but maybe also just do more with Azure.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:00.440
What do you say?

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.640
So a couple of things.

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:06.300
One is I've been doing a series of Azure innovation talks at build and ignite sessions.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.200
So go back to the last build and you'll see the most recent one of those.

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:13.660
And then at this ignite, I'm doing one that's just looking at AI related innovation.

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:19.500
So that's on Friday, tomorrow here at ignite, and it'll be available on demand.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.460
So that's awesome.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:20.820
Yeah.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.060
I'll grab the links to some of those and put them in the show notes for people.

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:23.760
Excellent.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.980
Well, thanks so much for being on the show.

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:25.260
All right.

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:25.860
Thanks for having me.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:26.080
Yeah.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:30.280
