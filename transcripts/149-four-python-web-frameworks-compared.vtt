WEBVTT

00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.860
Are you considering getting into web programming?

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.540
Choosing a web framework like Pyramid Flask or Django can be daunting.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.740
It would be great to see them all build out the same application and compare the results side by side.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.000
That's why when I heard what Nicholas Hunt Walker was up to, I had to have him on the podcast.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.320
He and I chatted about four web frameworks compared.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.340
He built a data-driven web app with Flask, Tornado, Pyramid, and Django,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.360
and then put it all together in a presentation.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.820
We're going to dive into that right now.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.200
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 149, recorded January 30th, 2018.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:52.500
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.620
This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.620
Follow me on Twitter, where I'm @mkennedy.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.100
Keep up with the show and listen to past episodes at talkpython.fm, and follow the show on Twitter via at Talk Python.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.640
Talk Python to Me is partially supported by our training courses.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.620
How does your team keep their Python skills sharp?

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.760
How do you make sure new hires get started fast and learn the Pythonic way?

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:22.760
If the answer is a series of boring videos that don't inspire or a subscription service you pay way too much for and use way too little, listen up.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.660
At Talk Python Training, we have enterprise tiers for all of our courses.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.220
Get just the one course you need for your team with full reporting and monitoring.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.940
Or ditch that unused subscription for our course bundles, which include all the courses, and you pay about the same price as a subscription once.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:46.260

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.440
Nick, welcome to Talk Python.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.360
Hey, thanks for having me.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.380
Yeah, it's great to be here.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.540
It was really nice to meet you last week at PyCascades.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.500
That was a fun conference.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.760
Oh, man, that was awesome.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.440
That was my second Python conference ever, and it was on par for me with PyCon.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.960
Yeah, it was definitely a different vibe.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.020
It wasn't like a huge expo hall or things like that, but I felt it made up for it in the richness of conversations.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.480
You could sit and talk with three or four people, and those people were amazing.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.800
Right, and the one thing that's been different is I've done a lot of academic conferences.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.620
I used to do astronomy, so I've been to a few national conferences, and I've always missed out on talks.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.300
And this is the first conference that I've gone to where I had the actual opportunity to sit and hear every talk.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.460
I didn't feel like I missed out on anything.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.760
Yeah, and the talks were really good.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.680
So congrats to everyone.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.460
That's a new conference, and you missed it this year, but it's coming to Seattle next year and then Portland the year after.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.060
And it's supposed to kind of go up and down the Cascades and the West Coast of the U.S., the mountain range.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.900
So it should be a lot of fun.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.100
I'm looking forward to going next year already.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:53.500
But that's not what we're here to talk about exactly, although we are going to cover a talk that you gave there, which sort of surveys a bunch of the popular web frameworks.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.400
And we'll get into that.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.900
So let's start with your story.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.560
How did you get into programming in Python?

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.960
Sure.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.220
I actually didn't think I'd ever be programming, ever.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.100
I started doing astronomy back in about 2007.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.360
I just got really interested in how stars lived and died.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.020
And so I started doing astronomy.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.880
I started doing science.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.980
It seems like one of the most amazing parts of all science is astronomy these days.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.300
Yeah.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.040
I mean, there's a lot going on in astronomy.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.600
A lot of my former colleagues are doing some amazing work finding planets, learning about black holes that we didn't know existed, all kinds of great things.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:33.820
When I started doing astronomy, I naively thought that I would just be looking through telescopes and taking down notes and thinking through equations and that kind of thing.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.520
I didn't think I'd be writing any programs at all.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.980
And so when I got into grad school, even before I got into grad school, I had to learn how to program a little bit.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.240
And I used Fortran 77.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.280
And that was, I hated it.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.840
I hated it.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.380
I hated it.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.000
I did, too.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I had to take it.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.340
I was in engineering at first.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.860
And they told me, I said, can I please take C++?

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.540
They said, no, you have to take Fortran.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.400
It's the most important language you'll ever learn.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.000
I'm like, no.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:07.220
Well, it's one of those things where, like, when you're in academia and you're an undergrad or you're in grad school, you learn the language that your advisor knows.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.060
And my advisor knew Fortran, so I learned Fortran.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.120
And then when I went, that was at Columbia.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.900
I was in the Bridge to the PhD program there.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.560
It's a great program for the scientists.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:26.000
And when I transferred into a graduate program at the University of Washington, then my advisor was using a language called IDL.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.780
I forget what it even stands for, but it's a proprietary language.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.880
So you have to have a license on your computer to use it.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.540
And if you wanted to be able to, like, do work at home, you have to have a license on your home computer to use it.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.760
And so it's a whole lot of stuff with that.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.240
You have to be connected to the internet so they can verify your license.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.500
Oh, it's that intense?

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.740
It has, like, almost like a dongle type thing?

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.340
No, it's not a dongle.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.580
It's more like if you're not connected to the internet, then you can't use the IDL editor.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.280
Wow, that's intense.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.960
And you can't run your IDL program.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.200
That's kind of the opposite of it.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.520
Which sucks.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.620
Yeah, it's terrible.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.560
Exactly, exactly.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.460
And so I actually learned Python partially to get away from IDL.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.460
It was kind of my way out.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.620
I was like, I had been introduced to this language, and I was like, oh, this is a free thing.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.800
I don't have to have a separate license to do this.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.340
I can install it on any machine.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.900
It looks like English.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.740
Like, this is...

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.260
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.920
Why not?

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.560
Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.800
So I used Python for my research.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.740
I used Python for my homework.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.600
And then one of my colleagues at the time, like, and this is kind of where it really took off for me.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.600
He had been doing blog posts about science.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.660
And I was like, oh, that sounds cool.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.320
I should do that too.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.920
And I used Python to help me learn more about the science that I was doing.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.360
And I was using the science to help me learn more about the Python that I was writing.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.580
And so I kind of got a lot of that practice, you know, after hours, just using Python to answer interesting questions.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.820
Yeah, that sounds really cool.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.440
It's a very organic story of just like, I kind of just found my way into it.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.000
And I just, you know, I sort of grew as you played with it.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
That's awesome.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.500
So like I said, I'm a big fan of astronomy.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.800
Are you still doing that today?

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.600
You're not, right?

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.600
You're sort of...

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.960
I'm not.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.320
You took the path that I did.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.240
Like, let me work on a PhD and actually do nothing and just go programming with it later.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.760
Now I just feel bad.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.340
But yeah.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.640
No, I know I do too.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.700
I kind of looked at my advisors and stuff when I left.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.720
I'm like, yeah, I'm sorry, but I'm going.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.420
It was tough, actually.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.640
But I think it's totally the right choice for me.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.420
I don't know about you.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.840
Yeah, it was time.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.980
I wouldn't make a second choice in a second.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.440
You know, I met some great people there, but I'm much happier doing what I'm doing now.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.740
Yeah.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.840
I feel like the PC experience in all of grad school kind of taught me how to do what I do now.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.260
But I feel like I'm applying it in a place that makes a bigger difference for more people.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.740
Right.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.140
I'm still doing as much reading as I was doing during my PhD program.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.280
I'm still doing as much thinking, but it's toward...

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.900
So one of the problems that I had with the work that I was doing in my PhD program was

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.360
it was not very easy to explain to other people why it was interesting or important.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.780
I knew why it was interesting or important.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.920
I love like aged stars and seeing how like what was happening as they were dying.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.920
But in order to explain that, I've got to explain, okay, look, this is how stars evolve.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.720
This is what all this stuff means.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.760
I've got to apply all this background.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.020
Whereas, you know, what I'm doing right now, I'm teaching at Code Fellows.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.940
And I can just say, you know, I'm teaching people how to program, you know, teaching people how to make websites.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:22.880
So, you know, the kind of stuff you see like a Google.com or anything.com, I'm teaching people to do that, at least at the basic level so they can go out into the real world and get a job and do that stuff for real.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.240
Yeah.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:30.720
And it's a great experience to help people sort of change careers or advance their career down some other path they weren't doing before.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.660
So what is a typical day?

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.940
So Code Fellows is a boot camp for those who don't know, right?

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.720
And what's a typical day there look like?

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:37.980
Yeah.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.120
Code Fellows is one of the coding schools in Seattle.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.300
I'm a little biased.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.400
I think it's one of the best ones.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.320
But I also work here and I know some really good people.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.180
But a typical day when I'm teaching looks like three hours of lecture.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.540
Let's say I'm teaching one of my Python lectures.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.140
It's like, okay, we do about an hour of code review.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.960
And then we talk about some topics.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.060
We do some data structures.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.780
We do some algorithms practice.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:09.260
I'll teach you about a web framework or some aspects of a web framework, like what a model is or what a view is or how to do routing or security, that kind of thing.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.340
And then we go to lunch.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.460
And afterward, they come back and they work with each other on lab assignments.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.220
And we build the lab assignments to complement the lectures.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.520
And so I teach a thing.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.240
And then they use that concept in their application.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.260
And after that point in time, they're kind of on their own.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.040
They're still on location.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.120
But they're on their own building the projects.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:36.860
And myself and the TAs are here to grade their assignments and to be resources when they need help.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.500
Yeah, that sounds like a really fun job.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.820
And how long does the boot camp run for?

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:40.900
The full sequence.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.240
So there's three levels to it.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.340
201, 301, and 401.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.080
201 is four weeks.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.400
And that's the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.680
And then the 301 is also four weeks.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.820
Because you have to do that.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.320
There's no way to avoid JavaScript.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:53.720
Right.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.880
Like there's no way to avoid it.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.040
That is the language of the web.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.080
Let's be honest here.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.340
Yep.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.220
It is.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.820
So 301 is also four weeks.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:00.560
That's more intermediate.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.800
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.660
We talk about jQuery.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.640
We talk about more libraries.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.300
We kind of get people kind of more interested in the wider scope of being a web developer.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.160
We start dipping into the back end a little bit with Express, but not too much.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.980
And then in the 401, that's 10 weeks.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.440
We have several 401s.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.980
We have Python.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:19.800
We have JavaScript.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.460
We have Java.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.160
We have C#.net.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.920
And that's 10 weeks.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:30.060
For the Python class, that's basics of Python, a preliminary web framework like Pyramid,

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.720
and then a more advanced web framework like Django.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.600
This is actually where my talk came from because I've been teaching this course or at least

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.340
being a part of the teaching process in some way, shape, or form for the last almost two

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.360
years and having all this exposure to it.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.520
And I was like, huh, I wonder what these other frameworks look like because I'd only ever

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:46.900
taught.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.520
I'd never actually learned Python for web development in my graduate work.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.400
I was doing astronomy.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.260
I was doing data analysis.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.700
I only learned how to do this stuff on the job.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:00.100
They don't have web frameworks for machine learning across.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.580
You don't build web apps, right?

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.660
You do build other stuff.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.120
Yeah, it's all custom software.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.900
Yeah, exactly.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.860
I'd never actually used Python for web development.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.000
So I only learned this stuff when I was on the job.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.160
And so I'd only been exposed to Pyramid and Django.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.160
I did a little bit of Flask just kind of as a one-off thing, but I didn't really understand

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.060
what I was doing.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.360
So I didn't really take the time to get to dig into these web frameworks.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.540
I was like, okay, I wonder what these other ones are like.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.740
I should try to talk about that because I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks this.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:34.060
No, I think it's a super interesting idea because a lot of times what I find is people,

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.560
they kind of do a quick survey.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.720
They're like, all right, what's out there?

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.080
Django.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.780
Okay, there's a lot of building blocks already built.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.620
They're kind of big.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.240
And I like, okay, well, there's a micro frameworks and they're really small.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:43.960
I put pieces together.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.600
This one or that one is mine.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.560
That's my style.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:46.980
I'm going to do it.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.380
And then they kind of just stop, right?

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.060
You learn what you need to know to do the job you try to do.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:51.320
Yeah.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:56.440
And most people aren't doing, unless you're a contractor, you're not doing a new project

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.120
every three months.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.040
In a different framework.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:58.380
Right.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.160
In a different framework or a different language entirely.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.900
You have your job.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:08.140
You might jump around from company to company, but you still like, most places are hiring for

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.160
Django, so you learn Django.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.960
Or they're hiring for Flask, so you learn Flask.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.960
Or you're just building tools for the backend.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:21.200
But yeah, in my 10-week class, it's all that plus data structures and algorithms and a little

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.120
smattering of machine learning.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.860
So it's like end to end with the week breaking between each class, it's about 20 weeks total.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.180
Wow.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.140
It sounds really fun.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:32.240
It's something like I could actually kind of enjoy hanging out there and just being part

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:32.400
of that.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:32.960
That sounds fun.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.480
It's great.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.160
It's super intense.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.960
And honestly, now that I've taught it, I really wish that I had learned to program this way.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.440
It's really directed.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.400
When you go through undergrad and you get your degree, you've got to do a lot of ancillary

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.120
stuff, which is great for building a well-rounded person.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.440
But if you're focused on just wanting to do one thing, it tends to get distracting.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.040
Whereas with this, the goal is clear.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.600
We want you to get a job.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:03.340
So we're going to train you to be able to do the things that jobs are asking you to do.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.180
And that's it.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.400
There's no humanities requirements.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.620
There's no other paths here.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.640
It's just like you're here for a specific reason.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.020
If your cause doesn't fit that reason, then you want to go somewhere else.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.360
But it's directed.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:15.940
It's focused.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.100
And it's cheaper than an undergraduate degree by far.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.280
Yeah.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.020
By quite a bit.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:22.340
Yeah.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.280
And time and money.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:23.880
That's cool.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.280
I mean, I'm a huge fan of the liberal arts education.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.520
I feel like it's good to be a well-rounded person.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:34.800
But I'm not entirely sure how much college should drive career training.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.740
You know, more like be a good person in society and be well-informed.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.940
Now go learn the thing, right?

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.280
Yeah.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.720
And I mean, it's also good for networking.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.060
It's good for, you know, expanding your interests beyond whatever you learned in high school.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:54.100
But, you know, most of the people that we get are people who are changing jobs, not people fresh out of high school.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:59.600
I've had a few people who are fresh out of high school, but most folks have gone through, you know, they might have an undergraduate degree.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.520
I've even had a few people with CS degrees, but they've had a job before.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.380
They want to do a different job.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.080
They don't need all the ancillary stuff.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.400
They just want to know how to do a new job, which is fine.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.020
And we teach them how to do that.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:11.300
Yeah.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:11.740
Yeah.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:12.180
That's cool.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:12.900
That's excellent.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.320
Yeah.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:25.600
So let's talk about your, the four frameworks that you chose and maybe even start with just because with the app, because your idea was, I'm going to build the same app in four different frameworks.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.220
Right.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.360
So what's that?

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:27.880
Yeah.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:33.840
So the app itself, I tried to keep it as simple as possible while still displaying, you know, the aspects of what a web.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.560
A framework should handle.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.460
And so I chose a to do list, which is, you know, everyone knows a to do list.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.960
So there's not much that needs to be explained in that way.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.060
So when I get to talk, it's like, Hey, you know what a to do list is.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.480
This app does that.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.400
You know, with this, with this application, you can, you can add new users through registration.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.520
You can log in, log out.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:54.240
You can add new tasks, edit existing ones or complete existing ones.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.520
You can even delete them if you want to.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:02.420
And so that's just kind of the backdrop for investigating how these four frameworks work.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:02.720
Yeah.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.980
That sounds pretty simple, but actually it touches on a lot of stuff.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.740
You've got a data access layer.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.580
You've got a database.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.780
You've got forms because you've got to post back information to register.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.820
You've got like secure user management.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.840
There's a lot of stuff actually going on there.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.560
Oh, absolutely.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.700
And I didn't, I didn't get to go into all of it in my talk.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.700
I didn't even get to finish writing all the code just because time got away from me, but

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.860
it's not just, I'm going to send some data somewhere and it gets handled.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.360
It's okay.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.780
How exactly is it being handled?

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:30.960
What exactly am I handling?

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.440
And how is every web framework supposed to be doing it?

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:39.940
And so when I originally wrote this talk, it was looking at each aspect of a web framework

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.180
across all four.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:46.900
And then I revised it to look at each web framework one at a time, doing all the things that's,

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.460
that the app requires.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:55.200
So I started with Flask and the setup and installation and then getting things up and running

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.800
configuration and then how to make a view.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.340
So like a view is just a function that handles a request.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.600
So an incoming HTTP request and sends back a properly formatted response.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.760
And the benefit of web frameworks, and this is definitely something that my students learn

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.920
because I have them build a web server from scratch as part of the course, is that you

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:20.500
don't have to worry about a lot of the stuff that goes into building a response or parsing

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.340
an existing request.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.720
There's so many different ways that an incoming request can go wrong.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.140
And you don't have to think through all that logic.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.200
You want to think more about how your app is supposed to work.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:29.380
Right.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.460
You could open a socket and just go to town on that thing.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:32.720
Right.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.340
But right.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.940
You know, splitting strings and using regex to find different parts of the request headers

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.180
and all that stuff.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.360
But who wants, no one wants to do all that.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:41.940
No, no, no.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.580
Something that's already pre-built.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:47.020
And you know, people smarter than myself have done it.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.440
So why should I do it myself?

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:48.860
Exactly.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.820
And there's people actively working on it.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.520
So the four frameworks you chose, you chose Flask.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.580
And then Tornado, I thought, was an interesting option.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.000
Yeah.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.340
I had heard about Tornado.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:03.420
And I didn't have any idea what it looked like, what it would do.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.820
But I heard the word async.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.920
And I was like, that should be useful.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.980
That sounds fun.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:09.200
Yeah.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:09.980
That sounds really fun.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:10.600
That's cool.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.700
So yeah, I'll dig into it.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:11.880
Yeah.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.640
And you've got Pyramid and Django.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.960
So those are the four.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.860
And let's, I guess, start with Flask.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.360
It's on the smallish side, right?

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.620
It doesn't bring a lot to the table.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:23.860
It's one of these micro frameworks.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:29.540
But for your example, you still use Flask, Flask SQLAlchemy, and Flask HTTP Auth, right?

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.060
Right.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:34.640
And I have to have those external packages because Flask really is the barest bones.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.540
Where a framework, it's just, you know, you can make a function that handles requests

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.940
and returns a response.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.040
And that's all that Flask does on its own.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:44.700
Yeah, pretty much.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:49.720
And so if you want to talk to a database, or if you want to do any sort of authentication,

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.780
you've got to use something else or write your own.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:52.980
Yeah.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.100
So like Flask, and there's benefits and drawbacks to each of those.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.020
So like if you want to use a database like a MongoDB database, you download the package

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.220
that someone has written to use Flask MongoDB.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:12.040
Or you can even just write, you know, straight up queries on your own without using a go-between.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.760
And then that'll work.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.000
Right.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.260
Just write a couple lines of code and like sort of piece it together yourself.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:17.540
Right.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.100
And that's something you can do, especially if you only need a very small application.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.940
Flask is the way to go.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:28.300
Once you want to start doing more of the classical CRUD application, CRUD being create, read, update,

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:32.060
and delete functions, you're going to start wanting to move away from Flask.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:36.000
Just because it can still do those things, but it becomes harder.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.540
Yeah, you do more of the legwork yourself.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:38.800
Yeah.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.880
So maybe let's go through, like, we'll kind of go through the same section for each framework.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:49.080
For Flask, let's talk about like, how do you like connect to the database and sort of incorporate that?

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:49.540
Sure.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.180
So I'm a fan of the 12-factor application.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:57.440
Give us the quick summary on what 12-factor app is, if you can.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:57.680
Sure.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:05.100
And the way that I'm trying to connect to it here is that one of the parts that's important is having your code not change between development production.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.980
Instead, be dependent on your environment and the variables that are set in your environment.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:17.340
So my application should have the same code running, whether it's on my own machine or on Heroku or on AWS.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.960
All that I'm changing are some flags, like, you know, am I in debug or not?

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.680
Is my database a local database or is it a remote database?

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.000
And so one of the ways that I do that is I use an environment variable.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.340
I call it database URL just because I use that everywhere.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.940
That's used in several places.

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.260
One of the places it's used is Heroku, so it makes it very easy for that.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:40.520
So I use an environment variable called database URL to point to my database's URL.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.660
And then I use an environment variable called Flask Gap to point to the directory of my Flask Gap.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:52.400
And then I put all my working code in the location of my Flask Gap, that app.py file.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:52.700
Right.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.940
Yes, you just have the app.py.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.320
And basically, you could just use Flask.sqlalchemy.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.820
And what is that like?

00:18:58.820 --> 00:18:59.700
Is that integrated?

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.740
It creates a sort of a base model, right?

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:06.320
If you do SQLAlchemy on its own, you've got to create the declarative base and do all of that stuff.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:11.580
And so the Flask SQLAlchemy kind of does a little bit of that work for you, right?

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.500
Yeah, Flask SQLAlchemy takes care of a lot of that work for you.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.860
It just gives you this model object that you use.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.520
That includes the declarative base and all the SQLAlchemy machinery.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.240
But just lets you focus on building the actual objects that you want to insert into your database.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.500
And it also does a nice thing for you where it includes a method.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.560
No, I guess it's not a method.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.380
It's an attribute on the model object that you create that will talk to the database for you.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:40.160
So you can query for one object by just saying, you know, object name.query.all.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.640
And that gives you all the instances of that object in your database.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.200
Oh, yeah.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:43.880
That's really cool.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.240
Because otherwise, you have to, like, create a session and then use the session to create the query.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.040
Right.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:52.140
Yeah, so it's kind of like a convenience wrapper around the SQLAlchemy stuff.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:55.420
But for the models and everything, you just define them the same, more or less.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:55.920
Right.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.080
You set up columns by declaring columns.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.360
Yeah, it's really easy.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.660
You set up columns by declaring columns.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.800
If you want a primary key field, you say, this column is going to have a primary key.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.160
And it's going to be true.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.560
Like, the primary key flag is true.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:11.800
If you want to set up an explicit table name, you have a table name attribute that you set in your class.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.460
Any other behavior you want to have.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.140
You know, it's still a class in Python.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.100
So you can still add whatever methods you want to do special things.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:18.980
Right, right.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.380
I find I don't do that often, but a little bit.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:28.060
There's sometimes there's just, like, a few things you want to compute in Python related to that entity.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.420
And you're just like, oh, it just needs, like, a property or something here.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.080
And it'll be perfect.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:31.700
Exactly.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:36.000
And one of the things that I use that for was, so in my models, I have two models.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.680
I have a task model, which is the actual, like, to-do list task.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.360
And then I have a profile model, which is the user who has the tasks.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:48.080
And one of the things I wanted to do was when you register a user, automatically give them, like, they joined.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:53.160
And then also automatically give them, like, a secret token that you can use to log in and log out with.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.000
And that's not handled by SQLAlchemy.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:03.980
And so in the init method, I just say, you know, do whatever you were going to do in your init method, but also set these properties on the class.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.300
Yeah, I really like that.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.720
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Linode.

Just visit talkpython.fm/Linode.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:12.100
So then also the Flask SQLAlchemy comes with sort of a create all function that would be the, you go get the metadata and then do that on the base, right?

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.080
There's like a little bit of a nice utility method there.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.260
Then when you talk, you talk about views.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.680
So in Flask, views are basically functions with a decorator.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.620
And they're super simple, right?

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.480
Yeah, and that decorator, yeah, absolutely.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.600
That decorator is the app.route.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.880
So like your Flask app is the app object.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.180
And everything goes through there, including the routing.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:35.000
And you decorate every function that you want to be a view with app.route.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.620
And you pass as an argument to that decorator the actual route that's going to connect to this view.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.000
So let's say I want to have a home route.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.140
I say slash home is that route.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:50.240
For my decorator, I say, you know, the app symbol, app.route, and then slash home for my route.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.260
And then directly underneath that, the function is going to be whatever handles that route.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:59.100
So when the home route is accessed, that function will run kind of like a callback in JavaScript.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:06.120
Yeah, the other thing that's interesting about Flask, I think, is this global request object that's kind of always there, right?

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.180
That was one of the weirder aspects of Flask.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.800
I'd never encountered that before using Flask.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.420
Because typically, like with other web frameworks, the request object is populated.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.060
It's a parameter.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.700
Just as a local variable.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:17.960
Yeah.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.940
It's a parameter in a function or a method in a class.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.160
But it's just populated for that one instance.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.220
And it's only usable by that one function unless you pass it somewhere else.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.580
With Flask, the request object is a global variable.

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.340
It is the incoming request.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:42.280
And it's usable not just by your view function, but any function or anything that you have in that file, that script file.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.840
You can use it to do whatever you want to.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:49.940
So you can set up, you know, background tasks if you want to use that request object without any actual reference to your view.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.120
Yeah, and that's kind of funky.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.680
But it also makes it pretty easy.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.600
I had the guys that did Quart.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:01.080
The guy who did Quart on, and Quart is an asyncified version of Flask.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.760
And this type of stuff was one of the things that made making it async really challenging.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:12.060
Because how do you control when the request thing points at the right one?

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.380
And then you release the thread, another one runs.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.420
It's like, it gets a little tricky.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.640
Yeah, I have no idea how that would work, honestly.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.640
It took some crazy monkey patching, as from what I understand.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.980
Good God.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.260
I mean, it's certainly possible, and I'm sure there's use cases for it.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.380
But I can't imagine the mess that must be under the hood when you're trying to do that.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.420
Yeah, it gets interesting.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:30.740
Yeah.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:37.820
All right, speaking of interesting, the one that is the most out there of the four that you chose, I think, is Tornado.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:43.040
And I'll just read the quick summary for Tornado that they put on their website, like the paragraph.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:54.480
So Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library, originally developed at FriendFeed, which is like some interesting early social media, for a non-blocking network I.O., right?

00:24:54.600 --> 00:25:00.300
So it scales to tens of thousands of open connections and makes it ideal for long polling, WebSockets, and so on.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:10.920
So if what you're doing is waiting on stuff, I'm calling web services, I'm calling database things, and I want to not block up my web tier when that happens, like Tornado is pretty cool.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.660
There's other options that are more modern, but this is like a really popular one.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.260
Yeah, definitely.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:24.780
Yeah, Tornado is useful for if you want to have a long-lived connection or if you want to do anything that requires some long-running input-output.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:31.480
This particular use case, this to-do list, is not the best place for Tornado to be used.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.840
It's still like you don't need to do async stuff with Tornado.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.720
You can use it just like a Flask or like a Django.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.420
It'll work the exact same way.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.880
It just handles requests and sends back responses.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:50.440
But if you do have a long-running task like a database query that's going to take a while to aggregate some data or maybe you need to send a request to somewhere else,

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:59.180
you can set up your views as coroutines that'll run in their own time and still free up the web service to handle other requests or do other operations.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:08.420
And it's really cool that way, and it's actually fairly simplified, where all you really need to do is know exactly which part of your code you want to, or which will be long-running.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:14.620
You set that up as being what's called a future object, something that's going to be running in the future, and set up the method as being a coroutine.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.440
Tornado will handle all the rest.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.960
You don't have to worry about the event loop.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.300
You don't have to worry about any of, well, most of the other asynchronous issues.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.940
It's just, it's done for you.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:24.260
Yeah.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.620
And so you're using SQLAlchemy here as well.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:34.020
And what gets interesting is SQLAlchemy itself is not async-enabled, coroutine-enabled, or things like that, right?

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:38.920
So you have tornado-SQLAlchemy, which lets you do that, right?

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.480
Mm-hmm.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:47.000
And the way that it does it is by setting up a context object where, so in that context, you have access to this session.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:53.600
And then whatever you would do with that session gets handed off as a task to your async event loop.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.140
And so you hand it off to the event loop.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.440
Your event loop continues to run.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:04.420
And you're not necessarily waiting for that process to finish before you handle your next request.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:13.180
It's just that when that process does finish, and the event loop is aware of that, then that response to that specific user is sent back as it needs to be sent back.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:19.240
The thing that it's not doing for you is, like, if you have some long-running computation, that's not going to be handled by a tornado.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:25.200
It's really just for input-output from some external service or from, like, clients.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:25.800
Right, exactly.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.400
You've got to have one of those things to make a future and wait upon it, right?

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.820
And if that's just compute, it's just going to block up the same thread anyway, so.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.740
That's an interesting thing.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:37.480
Like, I was never actually trained in understanding async.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.740
And so...

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.620
It's pretty mind-bending the more you dig into it.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:41.580
Yeah, it really is.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.020
It really is.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:42.900
It was interesting.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:49.060
And this goes back to PyCascades, where, like, I had kind of, like, dipped my toes into it with Tornado, but I was like, oh, I don't really know that much.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.120
I know I can decorate this method with a coroutine.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.160
It'll make it a coroutine.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.860
And then I got the privilege of being able to sit next to Guido during the speaker's dinner after the first night.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.720
And he talked to me for a while about, like, how async works.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.360
And I still didn't quite fully grasp it.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:14.140
But it was really interesting in how Python is still being a single-threaded process, but it's handing off tasks to be working in the background.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:19.640
And then I tweeted about, like, okay, I'm really going to be serious about learning about this async stuff.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.460
And he tweeted back at me, and he was like, hey, you want to check out this book?

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.080
And it's been great thus far.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:25.620
I've been reading.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.040
I've read through it about this.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.600
This is one chapter in this book about twice now.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.280
I'd say my understanding is at about 25% level.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.520
That's awesome.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.780
What was the book you recommended?

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:34.960
It was...

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.400
Let's see if I can put...

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.360
I don't have it on this machine.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:36.640
Do I?

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.620
Let's see.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.640
I'm going to look for it.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.380
And if I find it, I'll send it to you.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.060
Yeah, we'll put it in the show notes or something like that.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:43.400
Yeah, sure.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:43.920
Absolutely.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.640
But it's an open source book about...

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.440
It's very sharp.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.080
It's about the architecture of software.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:54.240
Oh, is it the one where they build all these different things and 500 lines of code or less?

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.420
Yes, that's what it was.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.160
Is it the article of Jesse Davis and Guido's article, maybe?

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.800
Yes, that is the exact one.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.140
Yeah, that's a good one.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.000
That is a really good one.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.180
A web crawler with asyncio coroutines.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:10.600
And it actually builds up what a coroutine is from ground level.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.760
It starts with your blocking sockets.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.140
And then it's still sockets, but non-blocking sockets.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:19.060
And then it goes to an actual web crawler using coroutines.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.460
And it's pretty awesome.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.860
Yeah, that's a really cool one.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.980
And I love the 500 lines or less aspect of it.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:24.800
That's pretty cool.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:33.040
Yeah, and for being 500 lines or less for such a complex topic, they do a really good job of explaining what async is and how it's supposed to work in the context of Python.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.280
Yeah, yeah, that's really cool.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:39.100
All right, so we've got these async coroutine view methods.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.500
Are they methods or are they classes in Tornado?

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.140
I can't remember.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.040
So the views themselves are classes.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:48.320
And you connect the views to routes in Tornado's central application object.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.480
You can have multiple applications running at the same time, which goes back to that event loop thing.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:59.540
You can have in your one Tornado project four or five applications running at the same time, doing and handling different things if you want to.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.600
But the actual method that gets run depends on what kind of requests you come in.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.400
So you know that you have several types of HTTP requests.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.820
You can get, post, put, delete.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:09.940
Those are the main ones.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.580
There's other like hen, option, whatever, but normally you should use those.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.620
And then there are corresponding methods for those.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:22.700
So when an incoming get request comes in, whatever code that I've written for the get method will get run for that request.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.800
And the response is built from that request, from that method, and sent back to the client.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.820
Yeah, that sounds really cool.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:33.140
So the sort of fundamental building block in Flask is you have a decorated function.

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.560
The fundamental building block here is I have a class.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:40.860
One URL points at it, but it can have different methods for the various HTTP verbs.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.200
So it's a little restful in that sense.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.700
It's a little restful in that sense.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.620
It works really well for a restful API.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:56.860
And the benefit of having it be a class is that you can set some instance attributes to only run for that one class, for that one type of request.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:01.060
You can think of them as, you know, semi-global things that only apply to that class.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:08.500
And you can have other methods in that class that work just for that class and whatever you want to do with those methods for those specific kinds of requests.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:25.480
For those methods, in this particular case, the to-do list, I add some methods to some base request handler for constructing responses, for setting default headers, for converting incoming data from post requests into Unicode, because they come in as byte code instead.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.220
Sorry, byte strains instead.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:28.560
That's really simple.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.480
It's just a method of the class.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.120
Yeah, that's cool.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:37.120
I find that that's a really nice design pattern, because there's probably like five or ten things like every web method wants access to.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.600
And if you put that in a base class and bundle it up, that's sweet.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.460
And that was very simple to do.

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:40.940
Yeah, cool.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:47.280
And then for the SQLAlchemy, even though it's the Tornado SQLAlchemy, you still basically define it exactly the same, right?

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.600
The declarative base and all that?

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.020
It is almost the exact same thing as Flask.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:56.200
In fact, when I first written this project, I wrote it in Pyramid.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:06.120
And then when I was going through Tornado, I was like, oh, I can just copy and paste everything I wrote for Pyramid into Tornado and copy and paste everything I wrote for Pyramid into Flask, because it's all SQLAlchemy under the hood.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.280
And that's one of the things I like.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:13.720
If you have an ORM or like I use Mongo a lot, so an ODM that you really like, they kind of are portable, right?

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.840
You learn the data part.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.960
It's almost like the 12-factor app idea that you were talking about.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:23.900
Like, you understand this part of your architecture independent of the framework, right?

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.460
Like the pieces, you put them together.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.940
They're not like locked.

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:31.700
And they're not like the one in the same, unlike, say, Django, which we'll get to in a second, right?

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:32.580
Right, right.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:36.280
Yeah, that's the benefit of using things like Pyramid or Flask or Tornado.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:41.460
And they're similar in the way that there is some basic framework, but all the rest is just building.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.240
It's just Legos.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:42.660
Yeah.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.680
It's all the same stuff.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:43.960
Nice.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.320
So let's move on to Pyramid.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:50.620
I think Pyramid lives somewhere in between Flask and Django, maybe a little closer to the Flask world.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.140
But I really like their philosophy.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:55.500
They're the start small, finish big, stay finished framework.

00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:02.440
And they say their philosophy is it should be very quick and easy for you to learn to start with a web framework.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:06.840
But the stuff that you need as it grows more complex is just there.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.240
And so that's kind of a nice philosophy, I think.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:26.260
One of the things that was nice about Pyramid is that I use the cookie cutter template for building a Pyramid application where cookie cutter is a separate Python package that you download and then you point out a repository to copy over some files for you to build your application.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.700
There are cookie cutter templates for Flask, Tornado, and even Django.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:32.460
I didn't know how to use those as well as I knew for Pyramid.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:33.520
So I just used the one for Pyramid.

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:33.700
Yeah.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:42.440
It's the official way to get started with Pyramid where the others you theoretically could use cookie cutter, but it's like there's some other sort of official starting point.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:42.980
Yeah.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.080
Actually.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:51.140
So it's interesting that you say that because when I first started teaching Pyramid almost two years ago, cookie cutter was not the way to do it.

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:51.400
It was.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.000
I was using Pyramid 1.8.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:53.140
Yeah.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:53.560
It was pcreate.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.000
Like when you install Pyramid, it installs for you a command.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.280
It's actually still there in the current version of Pyramid.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:58.500
Yeah.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:33:59.760
If you still want to use it.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.080
I think it delegates to cookie.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.340
It just is a wrapper around the cookie cutter now, I think.

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:03.740
Oh, is it?

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:04.560
I haven't actually looked at it.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.120
I think so.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.040
I'm not entirely sure either.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.600
That makes sense.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.560
Okay, cool.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:14.040
But yeah, like the pcreate command would say, okay, you want to create a pyramid application.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.760
You want to do certain things.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.600
There are various templates you can use.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.800
The basic pyramid template says, okay, you have some main function, which is your main configuration.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.700
Maybe you want to hook up some views.

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:24.920
Maybe you want to hook up some routes.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:25.900
Whatever.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:26.660
We got you.

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:31.800
With the SQLAlchemy cookie cutter template, it says, oh, you want a database?

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:36.120
Well, instead of having you write your own, because we know you don't know what you're doing,

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:40.580
we're going to give you a script for initializing your database.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:41.980
Here it is.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.040
It's called initializeDB.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.660
It does exactly what you think it's supposed to do.

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:48.580
Without you worrying about the actual implementation details.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:52.260
One of the things that I wish they had was an Alembic template.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.180
Maybe they have one now.

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:54.400
I haven't checked in a few months.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:59.560
But that'd be cool, too, because one of the things that's hard to teach what I'm doing

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:04.160
pyramid is, you know, you can actually, if you know how to use Alembic, you can set up

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:08.120
these things called migrations, which are snapshots of your model as you change it over time.

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:13.280
And that's a lot easier and better for production than just destroying it all and rebuilding it

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.800
from scratch every single time you want to make a change.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.060
Yeah.

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.940
The migrations are where that get tricky.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.860
And so the fact that if that were built in, that would be sweet, right?

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:20.500
Yeah.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.800
And I'm sure that at this point in time, someone's done it.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.020
I just haven't looked.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:24.400
Maybe.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.820
I mean, one of the things that you could do for your courses is you could take one of

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.880
these cookie cutter templates and make one that's like a little more focused on what

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.380
you guys are trying to end up with the end goal.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:39.440
Like I have my Python for entrepreneurs course, which has just a crazy amount of different

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.660
things brought into it, like bootstrap set up in a certain way and all sorts of templates.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:48.560
And so I actually created a cookie cutter template that is the, like, if you wanted to take what

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.500
we built through the 20 hour course and start a new project from it, you would just run that

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.380
new cookie cutter template and like you would start basically the end of the course.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:56.760
Yeah.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.760
That's awesome.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.000
Yeah.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:58.500
It's really fun.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.460
So that's a great idea.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:35:59.540
Yeah.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.460
It's really like you teaching the same thing.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.720
It's similar things you could like, you could help yourself by like,

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.300
tweaking one of these and forking it.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:06.540
Yeah.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.600
That might be a thing that I'd do in the future.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.420
I have been trying, like, as I've modified the course.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:15.260
So it's worth noting that I didn't, I wasn't the one who created the course.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:19.420
The course was created by this awesome guy, Chris Ewing, great developer, great friend,

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:20.900
extremely smart.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:25.100
And he created the course with Pyramid in there.

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:29.540
He had done Flask before, but he decided to go with Pyramid instead as just kind of a more

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.520
basic framework that could do a lot.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:39.520
And his idea was to not have the things that they learned be too heavily tied to just the

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.320
course that we teach.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.700
Because when they get out in the real world, they need to be able to understand what's happening

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:49.740
and not just fall back only onto what we taught, but be able to build up from scratch whatever

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.040
they need to build up for whatever job they have.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:57.220
The benefit of using someone else's cookie cutter template is that someone else has done

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:57.360
it.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:03.280
It's more likely to be used widely if someone's building a project and they can kind of just

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.620
get direct, they can feed directly into that pipeline.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:09.760
But I think now that you mentioned it, I'm going to, I'm going to see if there's an Alumbic

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.480
template out there for Pyramid.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.480
And if there isn't one, I might actually try to write one.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.460
Yeah, it'd be really cool.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:15.220
It would be useful.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:15.440
Yeah.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:19.300
I don't mean to derail you, but I do find this, these cookie cutters are really interesting

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:19.940
to roll with.

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.440
So this is how you get started in Pyramid.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:27.200
And let's say the terms of views, the default fundamental building block is very much like

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:27.980
Flask, right?

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:28.540
Oh yeah.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.640
It's just a function with a decorator.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:36.520
The difference between Pyramid and Flask is that your decorator, so your routes in Pyramid

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.660
are separate from your views.

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:42.800
They are just a listing of routes in, you can put them in a separate file, you can put them

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.880
in your main configuration directly, and they have a name.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:52.020
So like, again, the home route, it would be called home, and then the actual pattern that's

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.960
supposed to be matched to go to that route.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:58.860
And then your view has this view config decorator where you say, okay, here's the name of the

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.120
route that I want you to connect to.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.740
Here's also the way in which I want you to render the response of this view.

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.480
You can have, there's several options.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:11.080
One of those is JSON, so I can take my response, like if I pass a dictionary to my return value,

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.780
then my response will just be a dictionary, and that's JSON serializable.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:19.180
Or I can make it, I can use a template like a Jinja template or a Chameleon template or any

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:24.160
other template system that I want to, and just pass my response to that template, and Pyramid

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.960
will build a response for me and send it back to the client.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:31.000
You can also go with the Tornado style and create these like handler classes that get

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:31.600
one URL.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.420
You can, or they're called view classes, I think.

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:35.580
You create handler classes.

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.980
There's like a whole bunch of different ways.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.100
And I think that's one of the challenges of Pyramid.

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.500
It's the framework I like most.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.020
My web apps are built in it.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:45.920
But I do feel like there's all these different ways to do the same thing.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.800
So I'm never like, am I doing it the best way?

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.520
Or I'm just doing it the way that I know?

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.000
You know what I mean?

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.400
There's always a better way.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.780
It's more a matter of, my students often come to me with the question of like, is this best

00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:58.180
practice?

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.100
Is what I'm doing best practice?

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:05.880
And my response is always, well, best practice is oftentimes just defined by the person who's

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:06.400
paying you.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.800
What do they want?

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.140
It's a trade-off too, right?

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:15.600
If I'm building Google, I'm making different trade-offs than if I'm building a small hotel's

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.000
website.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.080
A best practice for Google is wasting money for the hotel and vice versa.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:23.340
The point there is that it always comes down to your use case, right?

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:30.540
If your use case would be better served by using class-based views and having the mix-in

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:34.260
pattern that Django has, then that's your best practice.

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:39.520
But if your use case is better served by a function, then use the function and be okay

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:39.880
with it.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.080
As long as the thing works.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.680
That's what matters more, is that the thing that you're building works.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:48.140
And then you can optimize as you need to for your specific use case.

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.000
Yeah, for sure.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.660
All right, so you brought up Django.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.220
Let's move on to Django.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:58.620
So the summary there is it's a high-level Python web framework, and it encourages rapid development

00:39:58.620 --> 00:39:59.960
and pragmatic design.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:06.400
So it comes with lots of pre-built stuff, and the building blocks are kind of large.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.680
They're more like Duplo rather than Lego building blocks.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.040
I like to think of them as, right?

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:11.560
Exactly.

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:18.320
I would even say they're more like, if you know Power Rangers, where the robots come together

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.360
to make one larger robot.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:26.300
There's still machinery in the individual robots, but their job is not to be inspected individually.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.140
Their job is to make one larger conglomerate.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:30.720
Yeah, yeah.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:35.380
One of the things that Django doesn't say in their description is that it is extremely opinionated

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.100
about the way that things should be done.

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:40.280
And so, yes, there are function-based views in Django.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.660
There's also class-based views in Django.

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:46.700
There's the ability to talk to a database in Django, but the database you're talking to should

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:47.980
probably be a SQL database.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:52.600
And the way that you build models in Django, at least through the tutorials and the documentation,

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.000
assumes you want rows and columns.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.420
There are ways to incorporate a thing like Mongo into a Django application, but that takes a lot

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.680
of extra legwork that you may not want to do.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.700
You're kind of fighting.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:07.940
You're going against the grain a lot of times, even though it's possible, I feel like.

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:11.860
Django, it encourages rapid development as long as you want to do things the Django way.

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:17.100
Which is oftentimes a good way to do things, but if you want to go outside that norm,

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.520
you're going to have to pull apart some code to do that.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.860
I think Django is good.

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:22.680
A lot of people use it.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:28.440
It certainly seems to be super effective for people who want to kind of get started quick

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.080
and stuff.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:34.260
I personally lean more towards the micro framework because I want to pick that little data access

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:38.360
layer and that little bit over here and just put it together, you know, but I think

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.900
that's just my personality.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:44.900
Yeah, but if you want to start quick and build big to start, then Django is pretty much the

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:45.360
way to go.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:45.640
Yeah.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.900
So in here, you design the models differently in a similar but different way because you

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:54.380
use the Django ORM, not the SQLAlchemy style, right?

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.740
Where the SQLAlchemy style has you inherit from this thing called the base.

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:59.580
It's actually fairly similar with Django.

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:04.040
When you're building a model, you inherit from Django's own base model, which handles the

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.860
database interaction layer for you.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.600
And then instead of having columns or column objects, you have field objects, but it's still

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.760
the same thing underneath.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:17.140
There are one of the benefits of using Django's fields is that there are some specific keyword

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.100
arguments you can set for specific fields.

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:23.400
One of my favorites is the auto now add that comes with the daytime field, which says, you

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.240
know, when you create a new instance of this object, then I'm going to just set the date

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:28.740
time on like for now.

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:31.360
Whatever now is, that's the date time on this field.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:31.800
Yeah.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:37.280
And you could do that with SQLAlchemy, but it's easy to make mistakes on it, right?

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:41.440
Like you could say, instead of saying the now function, you say now with parentheses and you

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:46.680
get like every model is marked at the time that when the app started, you know, funky stuff

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.060
like that.

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:47.520
Exactly.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:53.840
One thing that's always kind of put me off on Django is the way you define URLs is like

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:54.900
regular expressions.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.020
That's always sort of driven me crazy.

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:57.600
Yeah.

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.240
I mean, to a degree you do that in pyramid as well.

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.820
If you want to have any variable routes.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:03.160
Right.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.440
If you want to, you say this can only be an integer.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:05.980
Right.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:06.500
Here.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:06.880
Right.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:10.040
You say the variable name, but if you want to constrain it, then it's a regular expression.

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.460
Up through Django 111.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.600
I'm not sure if that's still the case in Django 2, actually, because they have the pattern

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:14.920
now.

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:15.720
They changed it.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.880
They changed the new pattern to make it a lot nicer.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:22.000
Up through Django 111, which is what I built the app in, is you have to have a specific

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
regular expression to be matched for your pattern.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:29.420
And the way that you, like the whole pattern itself is a regular expression, not just the

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.060
variable part.

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:35.580
Whereas with Django 2 now, it's a little bit more natural, a little less nuanced for just

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:36.140
regular expressions.

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:40.460
You can still do the old way if you want to, but they're encouraging you to use the new pattern

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:43.840
that isn't a regex unless you absolutely need it.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.140
Yeah.

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:50.160
So instead of having like a regular expression for the integer, you know, you just say angle

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:53.300
bracket int colon, you know, oh, so nice.

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.200
Right.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:59.060
But if you want an integer that's only, you know, that must be four numbers long, then you

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.480
want to get more and get more into doing regular expressions.

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.380
Yeah, that's cool.

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:03.040
All right.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.200
So you went through this whole experience.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.000
You went through these four frameworks.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.040
And to be honest, you just scratched the surface.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:15.940
There's a bunch more web frameworks like there's, there's bottle and there's webbed pie and there's

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:16.780
There's cherry pie.

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.380
There's sanding and cherry pie.

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:21.180
There's hug, which is apparently a web framework.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.720
There's, yeah.

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.640
Which is based on Falcon, which is another web framework.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:26.320
It's like, oh my gosh.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:34.160
So just to like, on one hand, this is just a sampling, but it is a sampling of the major

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.180
elements of the Python web framework.

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:37.800
So what are your takeaways here?

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:42.420
My takeaways here for these four specifically, because I just didn't have a time to dig into

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:42.980
any other ones.

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:43.740
Well, and it's a talk.

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:48.040
How many could, how many more could you have actually presented in like 35 minutes, right?

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:48.540
Right.

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:51.600
I mean, when I gave my talk, it was at 25 minutes, right?

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.940
And even with just these four and with just a little bit of detail that I gave for each

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:59.040
one, I still ran over time and I had to get cut off toward the end.

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.960
They're shaking that red thing at you like, oh, you're over time.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.460
Yeah, exactly.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.140
But my impressions were as follows.

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:12.740
For Flask, like Flask is good for small tasks or tasks that don't require a database.

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:15.980
You can still do database stuff with Flask, but it becomes harder.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:21.980
So if you're going to start small and stay small and be simple, Flask is the way to go.

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:23.820
It's really quick to get up and running.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.480
It's really simple to put together.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:30.820
And you can think more about the actual implementation of some of the logic you want to do.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:36.180
Pyramid is great if, as the slogan says, if you want to start small, but you anticipate

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:38.400
getting larger, Pyramid is great for that.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:43.260
If you anticipate getting larger and you still want to know what's going on, you want to have

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:47.680
a hand, you still want to have that do-it-yourself feel, Pyramid will give that to you.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:52.820
But it also can hand you some of the pieces to work with so you don't have to do too much

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:53.600
thinking for yourself.

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:58.240
Tornado is kind of like an in-between between Flask and Django.

00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.880
It can do Flask stuff if you want to do Flask sort of stuff.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.080
It can do Django sort of stuff if you want to do Django sort of stuff.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:08.320
But it's specifically good for any sort of asynchronous work you want to do or if you want to build a

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.860
chat room, that's good for Tornado.

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:15.080
If you want to have access to more of the bare networking layer of a web framework, Tornado

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:15.900
is good for that as well.

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:21.400
Django is if you want to build big and stay big, if you anticipate a lot of complexity

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.680
and you don't want to think too much about the details, you want to think more about how

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.120
it's supposed to all fit together, Django is good for that.

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:27.540
All right.

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:28.780
That sounds pretty good.

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:33.740
What other frameworks were you thinking about or have you thought about that maybe?

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:37.520
We sort of touched on them a little bit, but what else did you consider for this list?

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.900
I was thinking, so it's interesting.

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:43.420
One of the things that I only noticed after I started teaching about web dev is that we use

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:50.280
a Jupyter Notebook, which is a popular data science tool for displaying your analysis,

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.140
displaying your code.

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:54.140
When you install Jupyter Notebook, let me just check if I could be installing it right

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:54.400
now.

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:58.260
When you install Jupyter Notebook, one of the dependencies is a web framework.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.360
And the web framework is Tornado.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.320
I think in the past it might have been Twisted, which is another asynchronous web framework.

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.600
I didn't get a chance to look into it.

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:09.160
From what I understand, it's a little twisted for writing.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.200
But yeah, that's another web framework that I kind of wanted to get into.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.040
I had seen Web2Py, but never actually used it.

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:20.480
My friend Chris Ewing, he's a big proponent of Plone, which is an older web framework where

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.780
Pyramid learned a lot from what Plone used to do.

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:24.140
It's still around.

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:27.300
Yeah, it's almost like the next generation of Plone, almost.

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.640
The same people seem to work on it and stuff.

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:29.860
Yeah.

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:32.080
It's got some same idioms.

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.060
When I started doing web dev, I started with WordPress.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.900
And this is a long way from WordPress.

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.620
And I'm glad I didn't have to go through WordPress again.

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:41.820
Yeah, that's cool.

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.840
Those are all interesting ideas.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:48.640
I guess the other ones that kind of capture my imagination now are the async await enabled

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:54.640
Python 3 ones, like API star, Sanic, Jepronto, Cort.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.100
They're sort of the Python 3 only ones that are pretty interesting.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:02.100
I think I might look into those then because I've kind of really had the fire lit under me

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.200
for async.

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:06.020
I feel like it doesn't need to be this esoteric thing.

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:08.620
You know, it's a pattern in Python.

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.520
It should be learnable.

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:11.920
Yeah, it definitely should be learnable.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:16.600
I think, well, you know, you and I are teachers on one aspect of what we do.

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.660
So we can work on that stuff, right?

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:19.600
We can build it out for people.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.220
Yeah.

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:21.120
Awesome.

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.620
So I want to throw an idea out there that I just had while you're doing this that would

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:26.300
be amazing that you could build for the community.

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:31.340
You may be busy and not interested, but it would be amazing if there was like a website

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:34.520
whose job was to have these comparisons.

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:40.260
And somehow if it was like open to PRs, like somebody's like, oh, I want to submit an API

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:43.020
star version of the same app to you.

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.340
And that would be a killer community resource.

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:49.420
If it like it was available for the community to write this app and sort of write an article

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.380
for every framework that existed.

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:55.340
The GitHub organization that holds all four of the web frameworks is there.

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:59.200
You know, I'm perfectly happy to have PRs for that.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.140
Yeah, that's actually a pretty good starting point, isn't it?

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:04.600
So we'll be sure to link to your repo for this in the show notes.

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.060
Are you open for people to do PRs for you?

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:07.800
To do another one?

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:08.140
Sure.

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.140
Oh, yeah.

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:09.900
All right.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.800
So we talked about the web frameworks.

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.840
We talked about your boot camp.

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:19.100
What else have you got going on that you want to chat about that you'd like to let people

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:19.400
know about?

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.020
Yeah, absolutely.

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:23.900
If you're in the Seattle area, the meetup group Puppy, Puget Sound Programming Python

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:24.960
is really awesome.

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:28.620
I've been lucky enough to be involved with them for the last year and a half or so.

00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:32.280
And they're really open to new people, to new developers.

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:35.440
In the last year or so, we have a Slack channel.

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:40.180
We've started the Q&A channel in the Slack team for people to just ask questions.

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.300
We kind of have our own little Stack Overflow going in there.

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:44.160
You know, and also just random stuff.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:49.180
If you have a pretty much like whatever interest you have, the organizers, Don and Alan, two of

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:54.000
the people who helped put together PyCascades, they are always open to new ideas, to fresh

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.920
ideas, to people who want to get more involved.

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.000
So that's been cool to be a part of that.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.140
I've been really lucky there.

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:00.120
Yeah, that's really great.

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:01.820
And Puppy seems like a good organization.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.920
And what was surprising to me is how many people from Seattle and Portland we met in

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:07.280
Vancouver.

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:07.780
Yeah.

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:08.320
Right?

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.300
We left the country to meet people just down the street.

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.740
It's time and opportunity, right?

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:13.420
Like the conferences bring people together.

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:16.820
But, you know, when you're at home, you have your work schedule, you have your home schedule.

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:17.760
Like I have a kid.

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:18.920
I can't even go out that much anymore.

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:19.520
I know.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.180
I have three kids.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:21.320
It's like, go out at night?

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:21.940
What are you talking about?

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:25.780
Like it's super rare that I can go just hang out at like some tech evening event, right?

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:26.160
Exactly.

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.280
My wife's teaching or something.

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:27.980
I got to be home.

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.220
Right.

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:31.700
Like if I'm going to go to Puppy, I need to know like two months in advance.

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:35.440
You know, so I can, I can, I can warn my, my, my, my fiance.

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:38.540
I can warn her again, two weeks later and warn her again, two weeks later after that.

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.240
That, you know, I'm going to be going to this thing.

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.300
We have to get a sitter or like you have to stay home.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.060
You know what?

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:43.860
Something's got to happen.

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:47.360
So we can, there's a lot of, there's a lot of logistical stuff going on in there.

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:47.640
Right.

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:50.840
But you go to a conference, you kind of, you've already stepped away from that.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.160
You've created that space.

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:54.080
And so it's, it's easy to meet people, right?

00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.860
I'm here for this one specific reason.

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:57.680
Just learn about Python and meet people.

00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.700
So that's, that was cool.

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:02.100
And actually through Puppy, one of the things that I'm trying to do in the, in the coming

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.940
year is to be more of a mentor.

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:07.680
I've been, I've been the beneficiary of some really awesome people who have been mentors

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:11.280
in the short term or the long term to give me advice every once in a while, give me some

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.240
advice or, or help me deliver you through a process.

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:15.500
And I kind of want to give that back to the community.

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:20.180
And so as a teacher for the last two years, I've been able to graduate about a hundred or

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.580
more people from the Python program.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:24.720
And I kind of want to get back in touch with those people and kind of figure out like what they're

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.080
doing, what they're working on, where they're headed, where they're heading in their

00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:27.320
careers.

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:31.360
Maybe if I can, if I can, even if it's not a mentorship position, more, more like a

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:34.560
accountability partner, you know, help them move forward through their careers.

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:39.220
I like being able to have a hand in developing talent in the same way that people help me

00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:40.220
develop my talent.

00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:44.280
It doesn't take a lot of effort on somebody who's experienced on their part to just give

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.320
a little bit of guidance.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:45.640
Yeah.

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:49.600
Because when you're new, you just look around and it's even like, it gets worse every day.

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:50.560
There are more frameworks.

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:51.380
There are more languages.

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.280
There are more libraries.

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.820
You're like, I have no idea what to do.

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:57.980
I know I want to learn this stuff and I want to accomplish this, but where do I start?

00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:58.280
Right?

00:51:58.280 --> 00:51:59.320
Like, how do I go about this?

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.840
And so you can give them some guidance.

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:01.860
It goes beyond that too.

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:05.700
It's like, you know, well, you know, I never thought about giving a talk at a conference.

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:07.440
I never thought about giving a talk at a meetup.

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:12.040
I hadn't thought about giving a talk at a meetup until my friend Chris said, Hey, you should

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:12.760
give talks at meetups.

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.440
And I was like, Oh, I can, I can do that.

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:15.460
That's a thing that I can do.

00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:15.660
Yeah.

00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:16.480
There's no gatekeepers.

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.040
You just have to decide that you can do it.

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:18.680
Then you can do it.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:19.120
Exactly.

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:19.720
Exactly.

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:23.140
There are going to be some things that I'm aware of that people who are my former students

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:23.880
are not aware of.

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:26.080
Like if there's a panel going on, like, Hey, you should be on this panel.

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.140
We should attend this panel.

00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:27.940
We should meet this person.

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:32.840
You should go to this coffee meeting and see these people and be aware of these, of these

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:33.980
concepts of these environments.

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:39.700
Because, you know, have I found I've been in a lot of different spaces in the last, let's

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.100
say like 10 years or so.

00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:46.600
And what I've noticed in each of those roles has been that most of the work isn't just

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.900
being in the right place at the right time or meeting the right person at the right time.

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:57.480
And if you never meet that person or if you're never in that place, you don't even know that

00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.460
those opportunities are there to be taken advantage of.

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:05.660
Like I've been able to make some great contacts at Facebook just by going to a hackathon once and

00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:07.500
chatting up one of the organizers of the hackathon.

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:14.340
Or Twitter has been an amazing resource to meet people, see what they're into, learning

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:18.520
about other things going on in the field of Python development, just being aware of being

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:22.400
around and being able to help new people get into that community.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:22.640
Yeah.

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:27.540
I find that a lot of these little hands that you offer to people to help them actually

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:29.700
come back in unexpected ways.

00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:32.480
And, you know, there's a lot of karma in the world in that sense.

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:33.240
Oh, absolutely.

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.180
Absolutely.

00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:38.980
I never would have gone to my first conference as an astronomer if my advisor never told

00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:39.800
me about that it existed.

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:40.100
Yeah.

00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:44.560
And then I wouldn't have met the person who introduced me to Marcel Agueros, who runs the

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:45.900
Bridge of the PhD program at Columbia.

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:50.960
If I'd never gone to that, I would probably never be here in Seattle doing Python instruction

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:54.200
at Code Fellows because I never would have gone for a PhD at UDEL.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:58.500
There's so many things in the chain of events that could have gone a different way if I had

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.560
just been in the right place at the right time or talked to the right people.

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:06.380
I think the big takeaway here is you can't too deeply overthink these little variations

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:08.620
because your life could be so different.

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.760
Just, you know, sort of chaos theory, right?

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:11.880
Butterfly wings type of thing.

00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:12.360
Absolutely.

00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:12.880
Yeah.

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:13.240
Cool.

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:13.880
All right.

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.200
Well, I think we're getting close to the end of our time together.

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.560
Let me hit you with the two questions that I always put at the end.

00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:23.420
If you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you open up?

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:27.420
My first instinct is Sublime Text, but I've been going more toward Visual Studio Code

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:28.460
in the last week.

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:28.760
Okay.

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:29.300
Yeah, nice.

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.840
Visual Studio Code with a Python plugin is quite nice.

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:32.240
Oh, yeah.

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:35.860
I use Visual Studio Code for like if I just want to open up one file and stuff.

00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:36.780
I'm doing a big project.

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:41.000
I usually use PyCharm, but I definitely like Visual Studio Code as well.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:41.640
All right.

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.440
And then notable PyPI package.

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.900
I love the requests library.

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:46.060
I also love beautiful soup.

00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:50.360
And then pandas, when I was a researcher, pandas changed my life.

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.340
Like how I did research, how I did analysis.

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.880
I was using NumPy and NumPy arrays.

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:55.260
Pandas all the way.

00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:56.020
Oh, that's awesome.

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:56.340
Yeah.

00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.500
Pandas is really, really cool and important.

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:02.780
And to me, requests and beautiful soup literally feels like magic.

00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:05.820
Like there's this web page with stuff.

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:07.580
And then I write like five lines of code.

00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:10.820
And then I have it like in structured data on my machine.

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:13.420
I'm like, that just blew my mind that that just happened.

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:13.700
Right?

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:14.900
It is really cool.

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:15.320
Oh, yeah.

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:15.680
All right.

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:17.420
So final call to action.

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:18.400
People are excited.

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:22.840
Maybe they're about checking out these web frameworks, your project, or maybe even your bootcamp.

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:23.360
What do you say?

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:26.060
If you want to talk to me, the easiest way to reach me is on Twitter.

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:27.460
It's just at Enhan Walker.

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:29.360
I'm on there literally all the time.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.340
Probably more than I should be.

00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:34.040
If you're interested in learning how to code, Code Fellows is a dope place.

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:40.240
If you're in Seattle or in Portland, Code Fellows, great place to learn JavaScript, Java, C#, or Python.

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:47.440

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:47.760
All right.

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:48.180
Awesome.

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:53.620
Well, Nick, it's really been great to share the four framework comparison with you and the stories.

00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:54.780
Thank you so much for being on the show.

00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:55.560
Thanks for having me.

00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:56.840
I hope this was helpful to somebody.

00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:57.820
Yeah, I'm sure it will be.

00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:58.320
All right.

00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:58.480
Bye.

00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:58.800
Bye.
