Are you interested in getting ahead in data science? On this episode, you'll meet Sanyam Bhutani,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.940
who studied computer science but found his education didn't prepare him for getting a

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.400
data science-focused job. That's where he started his own path of self-education and advancement.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.860
Now he's working at an AI startup and ranking high on Kaggle.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.800

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.100
to Me. Michael, I'm disappointed I didn't hear the Steve Ballmer remix intro, but I'm very honored.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.060
Aha, developers, developers, developers. Oh, come on. It's so good. You know it's so good.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.600
I remember that was in your first few episodes. I think they came out right around the time I was

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.020
in university. Thanks for this opportunity. I've been a fan and listener of the show and

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.860
really excited to be talking to you. Yeah, I'm really excited to have you. I'm excited to hear

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.940
about your journey into data science. It's going to be so much fun because I feel like so many people

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.300
out there looking in from the outside, you know, they maybe didn't come into data science or to Python

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.940
from a traditional computer science education. And they feel like, well, I didn't go through that

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.400
path. And so I probably, this is not a good fit for me. I think that's very far from the truth. I think

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.300
there's so many opportunities to get into data science or to get into Python and programming.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.960
And while you do have some experience with computer science at the university, it sounds like as we'll

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.820
learn through your journey that a lot of what is actually effective had very little to do with

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.420
university. Let me start out on a spicy note. I studied computer science at a university at one

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.820
of the best universities in the country. It didn't make me a better programmer at all. Let me start

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:28.100
with that spicy opening. That is spicy. Now you've thrown it down. And I want to come back to that,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.440
but let's just start with your story. You know, what got you into programming first? Was this a

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.120
university thing that you pursued or were you interested in that beforehand or how'd you get into

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.660
programming? Sure. So I was the standard nerd definition. I enjoyed spending time with computers.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.140
Whenever my parents would go to sleep, I'd figure out a way to sneak into the computer room, just play

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.360
games all night. And along the way, I think somewhere in high school, I discovered programming.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.440
It was Java, unfortunately, but I saw the promise of it. I saw all of these interesting things that were

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.920
happening around it. And somewhere I just made up my mind that, Hey, I want to take up computer science

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.400
because that's what coders do. Unfortunately, not as I learned later. That's how I got interested in it.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.660
And that's why I decided to take up a course in it. Yeah, that's fantastic. I never took computer

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.720
science as a major in college, but I studied math and I had to take a couple of programming courses

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.580
to sort of fulfill my math degree requirements. And yeah, I found it to be a mixed bag. Like I had to

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.060
learn Scheme and Lisp and I thought, well, that's not super practical, but...

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.560
What are those?

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.060
Yeah.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.760
But I've got to start here. I was like, please let's do some C++ or something. Like, no,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.420
no C++ for you. Darn it. And then I was told I had to learn Fortran because it was the most

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.000
important language I would ever learn. Turned out to not be true, but I learned Fortran as well.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.280
And eventually I got into some fun languages that I got to build some things.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.040
Well, I don't know how you felt, but my experience with being in a university, and this is speaking

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.820
from doing this in the nineties. So it could have absolutely changed, right? I haven't gone back to

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.780
the university since, but I didn't get a lot of projects that I really loved that I was really

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.660
super excited about. It was like, well, you're going to need to learn how to do this algorithm

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.820
by hand on paper. And you're going to need to implement this in this sort of archaic,

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.460
weird language. You got to do this.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.700
You're compiling stuff in your head through paper. Talk about state of the art.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.460
Yes. Oh my gosh. I'm like, why, why do we not get to use computers in our computer science course?

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.860
This is crazy. I just don't get it. But here I, here I am. So I didn't come away feeling like it

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.640
made me a super good programmer. It gave me some exposure and some interesting experience, but my

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.720
real exposure that got me into programming and told me, like revealed to me, like you can do this.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.260
And this is for you was when I was doing a research project that had to do with math and

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.120
not programming, but it needed a little pro it needed some programming to do the simulations and

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.520
do the work. And I'm like, well, now this is super fun. This is the kind of stuff I wanted to do. And I

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.740
was up at 2am, you know, working on it in the computer labs then, because all of a sudden it was really cool.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.140
So I don't know. Hopefully computer science is more practical these days, but I didn't find a huge

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.740
value in those computer courses I took at university.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.860
To be honest, like I relate to that so much. I could just rant about this for hours, but I signed up for

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.620
computer science because there was this notion in my head that, hey, computer science is where you do

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.000
programming stuff, right? You make computers smarter. And then they're teaching us all of this stuff that,

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.080
you know, doesn't really make sense. Like I remember listening to talk Python those days,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.480
and you were talking about PyPy, which I didn't know what was because they never told us what it was.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.860
And I'm listening to all of this stuff. And what they're teaching us is how to make for loops,

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.980
print out patterns. Like I don't see how these things connect, right? You're talking about flask

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.480
building apps on talk Python. I just heard Michael talk about it. But now what is all this stuff?

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.860
What is inheritance? Where does it come into the picture? And there was this huge disconnect for me.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.040
So very much echoed that experience as well, unfortunately.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.980
Yeah, that's interesting to hear you look back on it. One of the things that you talk about in some

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:15.180
of your writings and some of your experience, and we'll get into it, has to do with top-down versus

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.200
bottom-up learning. Before we get to that, I want to make sure you get to answer both the opening

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.140
questions. So what are you doing these days right now before we dive into that aspect of learning?

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:29.460
Sure. I currently work at h2o.ai, which is a company building auto-ML products. I'm sure we'll

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:36.580
get into this later on as well. I work as a content creator slash engineer. So we have a makers gonna

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.960
make culture, which means that I have absolute freedom to bring ideas. Usually people don't stop

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.540
me and they encourage me, which also means that I can do a podcast at work. I started a podcast,

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.920
a while ago called Chai Time Data Science, where I interview my heroes. A lot of them are Kaggle

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:58.560
grandmasters. So we can talk about this later as well, but Kaggle has different tiers. Grandmaster

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.340
is the highest one of them. S2O has, I think, more than 20 grandmasters. So at some point I said,

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.920
hey, can I interview our people? And they said, yes. So I have a lot of freedom over stuff I do,

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.540
but it's a lot of creating content and things in those domains. So blog posts, videos,

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.280
I get to do meetups as well. That sounds like a really fun job. It is.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.480
This whole exploring ideas and creating content and interviewing people and just being out in the

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.860
community. It's the aspect of programming that when people first hear about it, I think is extremely

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.620
surprising, right? Yes. A lot of people think of programming, especially before they really get

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:38.100
into it, it's this solitary thing that kind of geeky, super smart people do, mostly alone,

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:43.400
mostly to avoid other contact with others, right? And then as you get into it, you learn like,

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.660
actually there's a whole lot of team dynamics and programming. And then there's these roles that

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.740
are like developer evangelist, which sounds pretty similar to what you're kind of doing,

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:58.460
like community outreach on the dev side, which is very social and outgoing and interesting. And so,

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.620
yeah, it's a whole spectrum. It's a lot of fun for sure. And yeah,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.620
it would be closest to evangelism, but also I have a lot of freedom to do a lot of, honestly,

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.760
anything I bring to the table, usually I get positive feedbacks about it. So I just keep doing stuff,

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.760
even if it's interviewing people over time.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:19.960
Yeah, that's fantastic. So back to my top down, bottom up thing that you talk about. In a lot of

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:26.840
academic, you know, high school, college settings, the foundation is set at the beginning, right? Okay,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.880
well, we're going to teach you how to do derivatives or differential calculus. So what we're going to do

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.000
is we're going to start out real, real simple. And I'm going to talk about what does a difference look

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.160
like, and then we're going to talk about limits. And then we're going to, you know, eventually,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:44.080
like two months later, you can do derivatives and you can actually do calculus, right?

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:44.400
Yeah.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.840
That first two months, you just have to have faith that I'm just going to keep cranking on the details

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.920
until something interesting happens.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.120
But even after those two months, like you get to solve these problems, you get to, at least for me,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.280
I was able to confirm that, hey, the answers I'm getting match with those in the book. But what's

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.700
the point of all this? Like, okay, I'm able to solve these problems. I know how to ace my test. I know

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:12.300
how to match into that. But where will this be used? I'll never find out. And I just didn't have the

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:17.840
passion for it. My only passion was, I need to get good grades to get into a good university. But apart from

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.060
that I had no real...

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.980
Right, right. I want a good job, but like, this must be the path.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:22.840
Yeah, basically.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:29.300
Yeah, yeah. I hear you. And I feel like so much of academics and many presentations and courses are done

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:34.640
this way as well. They, but especially academics, because you have to finish it to get the grade,

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.460
to get the degree. So they're like, well, it's fine if it takes three months before this is interesting

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:44.400
to anyone, because they have to stay here. They have no choice. Like, we're going to build up slowly,

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:51.380
bit, bit at a time for three months, because guess what? They're all enrolled and they need this.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:55.740
This is a required course. And so we're going to make sure we get every little detail in place along

00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.440
the way. And eventually it'll be interesting to them. I just feel like that is so backwards

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.740
from trying to capture inspiration of people, you know?

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:09.780
Somehow, every single time there's always this disconnect, like, okay, I get it. At some point,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:14.480
you have to know the concepts, but you're never told of the bigger picture, which is what is a

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.360
larger focus in the top-down approach. So I never know where these individual things will really be

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.660
used. It's like, before you get to drive, you need to know about the thermodynamics of the engine

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.820
rather than sitting in the driver's seat.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.440
Yeah, there's a beautiful Ferrari you want to take out for a drive. And you're like, no,

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.880
no, no, no, no, no, no. We're going to study physics, study thermodynamics,

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.760
a little chemistry for the combustion. And then a couple of years, you can take that thing for a drive.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.200
Exactly. And I feel like it actually captures it pretty well. You know, contrast that with,

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:48.680
well, let's just teach people the rules of taking a derivative, right? Derivative of x squared is 2x.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.760
Okay, great. Now let's show them how they solve cool problems. Like, oh, here's a ball flying through

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.820
the air and we can figure out its velocity when it hits the ground based on things like the derivative

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.900
and acceleration and so on. And then eventually, once you're like, this is really interesting,

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:07.460
then you could talk about like, all right, now let's dig in. Let's talk about like the details of why

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.980
this math or this data science algorithm works. And it just doesn't really go that way. So I think

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:18.440
that's definitely an interesting part of the journey that you had to make that switch, right? To sort of

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:24.640
go from this like really theoretical academic background to, oh, I've got like a Kaggle competition.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.180
Yes.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:30.680
And I've got two weeks to solve the problem. Like we can't be rebuilding it from the foundation. Let's go

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.380
the other direction.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.260
Yeah. Just to be clear to the audience, I just did a bachelor's in computer science. I didn't do a

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:44.560
master's or PhD. I gave up on academia midway. But yeah, echo on that. And it's the top down approach.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:51.340
I was introduced to this through fast.ai. They are a big advocate of this. And that's how I became a fan

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:57.000
of this. Essentially, what they cover in their blog post is you're given the baseball bat and you get to play

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.220
first rather than being taught the physics of the curveball. And I think at least for me, in retrospect,

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:10.340
the main challenges throughout all of these months of learning a subject in university, you need to be able to

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:16.960
stay motivated. And remember why you've taken up a course. I took up web programming because let's say I want to learn

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:23.060
how to make websites and not because I need to remember what HTML tags come in the final semester question every year.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:28.800
And somewhere in the middle, you lose out on this motivation. And the top down approach essentially takes care of that.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:34.680
That, hey, bring your project and figure out stuff along the way. And I think I mentioned in our interview, I think

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:41.440
talk Python courses really cover this well because you're given 10 sets of projects and you can just build them along the way.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:46.360
Yeah, thank you. Yeah. I mean, I really am a big fan of this because I think, and I tried to incorporate the courses

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:52.340
that we have, because I do think you need to have these little wins right away. And you hear a lot of times

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:58.340
people talk about like, well, if you're teaching kids, the kids need to have these like good experiences early.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:05.240
It's like, you know what? Replace kids with people. Like people just, they've got a lot of time and other options and you want

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.920
to make them feel good and excited and like they're making progress. They need to make progress,

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.180
even if it's little steps to the beginning, make it feel like legitimate progress, not just algorithms

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:21.380
and loops and stuff like that. Yeah, absolutely. So you went through your computer science degree,

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:26.360
but you didn't come out the other side feeling like a data scientist. And this was around the time

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.720
of the MOOCs, right? The massive online open courses. Is that what this stands for?

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.800
I think so.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:39.280
I think so. Something like that. It might have several variations. And one of those is over at

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:45.200
fast.ai, right? Focused on deep learning and data science type topics, right?

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:51.620
Yeah. So just going back to the universities, like you said, I was just really unhappy that, hey, there's this huge disconnect.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:58.940
And like any smart person in their 20s, I just spent a lot of evenings ranting about it.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:06.520
And at some point I decided, OK, this is going to help me. And I just started signing up for every single course on the

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:13.980
internet. I used to say this proudly that I've done 50 plus courses to my peers who would look up to me that, oh, this guy's...

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.940
Oh, I've only done 10.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:21.120
Yeah. But in retrospect, I was just being dumb and chasing all of these courses. Fast.ai, in retrospect,

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:27.980
and I keep saying this, but it's the most impactful course in my career. So Fast.ai is not just a course,

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:34.360
it's also community and software. But I got introduced to top-down learning through them. And they make you

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.360
excited about this stuff. In the first lecture of the deep learning course, they have a bunch of courses.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.840
They teach you how to put together a few lines of code. Of course, you don't know what's happening,

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.040
behind it. But you build something that's state-of-the-art. And Jeremy Howard, the creator,

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:52.920
shows you how you can get to the top of a leaderboard on a Kaggle competition. I don't know

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.800
what's more exciting than that, at least to someone who was printing out star patterns in university.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:03.920
Yeah, that's really neat. And I think the community aspect is also pretty important, having that ability

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:09.920
to sort of bond with people there. So MOOC, the M stands for massive, like number of massive in terms

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.760
of number of people, because it's a large group. I haven't gone through their courses or anything.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.380
At this point, it's a few hundred thousand people, I'm sure might be more than that.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.760
That probably counts as massive. You know, if you compare it against a 30-person college course or

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.400
whatever. Yeah. Okay.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:29.660
The biggest mind opener for me was, we suck at diversity in tech, right? No other way of putting

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:36.680
it. And just talking to different people on these online communities, people who don't have computer

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.640
science degree or were coming from different walks of life. I didn't understand that, hey, you're supposed

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:47.200
to have other responsibilities as well. You're supposed to be helping your family out. I just assume you can do this

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.600
in your free time and that's all you do. But that was also a mind opener for me during those days.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:58.600
This portion of Talk Python Army is brought to you by Sentry. How would you like to remove a little stress from your

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:03.960
life? Do you worry that users might be having difficulties or are encountering errors in your app right now?

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:09.960
Would you even know it until they send that support email? How much better would it be to have the error and

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:15.980
performance details immediately sent to you, including the call stack and values of local variables and the

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:22.880
active user recorded in that report? With Sentry, this is not only possible, it's simple. In fact, we use Sentry

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:29.260
on all the Talk Python web properties. We've actually fixed a bug triggered by a user and had the upgrade

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:34.640
ready to roll out as we got their support email. That was a great email to write back. We saw your error and

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.260
have already rolled out the fix. Imagine their surprise. Surprise and delight your users today.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:44.380
Create your Sentry account at talkpython.fm/sentry. And if you sign up with the code

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:51.600
Talk Python2021, it's good for two months of Sentry's team plan, which will give you up to 20 times as

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:58.200
many monthly events as well as other features. So just use that code Talk Python2021 as your promo code

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:07.020
when you sign up. One of the things I really value about the Python community is it's not just straight CS

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:14.720
to sort of deep applied Python out of like this university chain, but rather so many people are

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.660
brought in from different areas, right? People are interested in biology and they learn a little

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:23.580
Python. People are doing astronomy and they learn a little Python. People are building Instagram and

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:29.640
you know, they're using Python. So there's just this diversity of viewpoints and specialties that

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.900
comes to Python that's really unique. And it sounds like you kind of got that feeling as well here.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:40.380
I was always very welcomed by and the fast day community especially is very warm and welcoming. So

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:47.060
it's at least at that time, I went to Reddit to ask a few questions. And I got a lot of harsh feedback,

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:53.460
which really demotivated me. But fast day community was the exact opposite at that time. Reddit is a lot

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:58.760
better now. Any other community for that matter. But it's a very welcoming community. And no one says

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.900
that, hey kid, you're not supposed to be asking these stupid questions. Rather, even the creator

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:08.740
himself, Jeremy Howard often hangs out in the forums, answer all of the questions. So it's really put back

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:13.340
the inspiration in me while I was just in this dark phase, nothing making sense in university.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:19.820
Yeah, very cool. So there's a couple of things that you've done. Let's set the stage and then we'll dive

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:25.820
into the details on them. So as you've gotten your degree, if you've gotten better in data science and

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:31.500
deep learning, there's a handful of things you've done to give back to the community and stretch yourself as

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:37.900
well. One is to work on your blog and write articles. Two is to create your podcast, which I was happy to be a

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:44.680
guest on a while ago. It's very nicely done. Thanks for saying yes. It was a very exciting moment to host you,

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:52.200
honestly. Yeah, thank you. And yeah, so the podcasts and then also the Kaggle competitions. So let's start

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:58.400
with your blog posts. I just pick a couple out of here that are interesting. One of them is how not to do

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:05.820
fast AI or any other ML MOOC course, right? Yeah. And so you go through sort of how you

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:11.200
approached these courses. You talked about how you took 50 courses, which is on one hand, I think it's

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:18.600
really awesome to get that exposure. But on the other hand, to really master programming, you need to

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:25.460
stop and try to like solve concrete problems, fail at that, figure out like, well, I'm trying to solve

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.820
this problem. I can't even get a virtual environment set up to let me install this library. Like what is

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:34.300
going, you have to hit your head against that. And it feels like you're bad. It's just, you know,

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:40.280
it's building layers of experience in a way that like, it's not the funnest, but you got to go through

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:45.140
those steps and then you sort of work your way into developing that experience. There's not a super

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:50.240
shortcut. Having the courses helps give you the perspective and know where to focus, but it's still,

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:55.740
you kind of got to go through that path, right? So maybe talk us through how you approached it and

00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:00.500
then the advice you might have after. Yeah. And to counter back also, just generally speaking,

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:08.380
maybe I'm not the most outward looking person, but I didn't find these ideas of, you know, building any

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:12.160
projects. So I couldn't think of a website that would look interesting. So I would just go to a course,

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:17.560
assuming that I would learn all of this stuff. And a lot of these MOOCs are very nicely marketed,

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:22.420
that they make you feel that, okay, I'm going to come out learning something. So I just followed

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:28.100
this trail of stuff that I would keep looking up. I need to know Python. So I would do a Python course.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:34.860
Then I would take a course on different frameworks, keep doing that. And even at the end, I didn't

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:39.340
accomplish much because again, there was this huge disconnect because if anyone would tell me to do

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.900
anything that's slightly outside of the curriculum, I would fail at that. And that's just because I didn't

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:50.500
experiment as much. And by in retrospect, I should have spent at least thrice or twice,

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:57.900
at least twice as much time just trying to quote even the stupidest idea possible instead of just

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:02.940
watching those lectures because they felt in my comfort zone that, okay, I'm learning something,

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.300
but I wasn't learning something at that point.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:10.400
Well, you are learning something. I do think that being able to watch the lectures of an online

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:16.260
course and following along, like you're getting real exposure and real stuff, but you're not,

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:20.300
even though you're feeling comfortable, you're not at a place where if somebody said,

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:24.500
now go build something different, it's not that different, but it's different and do it from

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:29.700
scratch, right? You're not building up that skillset unless you're also experimenting along the way.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.940
Yes. And I'm sorry, just to clarify. So this wasn't for the first course I had taken like at

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.920
least 10 of them and I was watching the same stuff over and over again. So at that point,

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.340
it was a waste of time, I think.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:45.920
Yeah, for sure. For sure. So you said, all right, well, I'm not so sure that the way I was doing it

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.180
was totally the right way. So what would you say is the right way? What some advice would you give

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.520
there for being successful in these online courses?

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:59.160
Sure. I'll point out to a book by Rade Kosmalski, who I had interviewed on my podcast earlier, but he's

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.500
put out a book that essentially talks about different things that you should be learning or how should

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:09.440
you really approach learning. And in his book, he talks about code twice as much as reading theory,

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:15.460
have this northern light of an idea. I wasn't again, I couldn't think of anything. So I took to Kaggle

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:20.860
the competitions. In my opinion, at least in my opinion, just do fast theory and then jump on to

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.880
Kaggle. Those are the two best places to learn about data science, in my opinion.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:29.900
So the Kaggle competitions are interesting. Let's maybe talk about those for a little bit.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:30.140
Sure.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:36.680
I haven't talked about Kaggle a lot on the show. I'm sure people are mostly familiar, but maybe not

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.540
everyone is. So just tell us what is Kaggle.

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:45.300
Sure. And fun fact, the CEO actually tweeted yesterday. So at this point, Kaggle is at seven

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.920
million users, I think. So when they say they're the home of data science, it's really the biggest

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.680
community in data science. And why do I say community? It has competitions that are hosted

00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:00.340
on the platform. So different use cases for different companies exist as competitions.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:07.020
Now, as you can see, the first one is an example one, but different competitions are brought onto

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:14.220
the platform by companies who want the community to solve a problem. In return, there are price pools,

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:18.840
but really what people are there for is the knowledge sharing that happens. And how does

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:24.840
that happen? They also have very nice discussion forums, as well as notebooks. At some point,

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.000
they call it kernels if you're not familiar. But essentially, you can host Jupyter notebooks

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.240
on the platform where people share their stuff. And this is the best of the best on the platform.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:38.840
So they share tips and tricks of how you can approach the competition. And then you start to

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.280
try and compete on a leaderboard. And you get real time feedback because there are at times

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:47.520
thousand people competing on the leaderboard, which may or may not be a good experience,

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.840
from my experience, at least for the first few competitions. But it's very exciting.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.700
It's a little bit like a hackathon type of thing, but very focused on a data science problem,

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:01.440
not only generating an app or a website. Maybe that's a good elevator pitch.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:01.860
Exactly.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:08.300
Okay. So I'm sitting here looking at Kaggle.com slash competitions. And yeah, I can see a bunch

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.780
of interesting things. It doesn't explicitly say who it's sponsored by on the outside. Maybe if I click

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:20.400
and it'll say, oh yeah, this is brought to you by or sponsored by or put out by so-and-so. But the

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:27.880
first one is a Simphysibio RSNA COVID-19 detection, which sounds like a bunch of acronyms. I don't know

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:35.160
anything about it, although I've heard of COVID. The idea is to identify and localize COVID-19 abnormalities

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:42.680
in chest x-rays, which is interesting. And that's a genuinely useful thing that we could all benefit from.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.640
Right. Having machine learning that can assist doctors and say, wait a minute, wait a minute,

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:53.280
this person seems to have either had or currently has COVID based on this picture. Let's do something

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:58.320
about that. That's genuinely helpful for society. And if I can just point out, at least for this

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:03.020
particular competition, I think it launched a few days ago. And just in those few days, you already

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:09.820
have 450 people that are, I can say just hyper, they'll be hyperactive in the discussion. Then a lot

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:14.300
of us just go there for the learning. I'm sure most of us just go there for the learning and things you

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:18.700
get to experiment with and learn on there. Yeah. And it says the prize for this is a hundred thousand

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:25.640
dollars in the US, which is pretty sweet. Is that split like number one gets half, number two gets a

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.380
quarter and it like trails off or is it all or nothing? Number one or zero? I think it's in the top

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:36.700
three, sometimes in the top five. It varies from competition to competition. And again, it's really hard to get into

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:43.020
the top. They have medals. They've gamified all of this stuff. And how's that helpful from an outside

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:48.820
perspective? As you gain medals, you move higher up the ranks as well as tiers. You start as a novice,

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:54.980
then you become a quote unquote expert, master and then grandmaster. So as you earn a certain set of

00:25:54.980 --> 00:26:01.800
medals, you start on your part towards becoming a grandmaster. So that's more exciting than the prize pool.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:08.300
Again, legends or very experienced people are aiming for the prize pool. I don't think I've ever even

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:14.620
dreamt of that. Right. If it's, you know, too far out of reach, it's not worth trying to worry about

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:19.580
that. It's more about making the progress and seeing yourself go up in the charts and gain that

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:25.240
experience. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So let's see some other ones. I went and sorted by prize purse here. So

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:30.800
Jane Street market prediction, test your model against future real market data. That's interesting.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:35.940
there's 4,000 teams competing for that. There's one about discover how data is used for the public

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:43.120
good in the US for 90,000. That's pretty cool. Major League Baseball has one on digital engagement

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:48.900
forecasting. So predicting fan engagement for a baseball player, digital content. That's pretty

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:54.240
cool. This launch, I think less than a day ago and there are already 15 teams on there. I'm sure if you

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:59.000
go over to this competition, you can see some stuff in the discussion and kernels already. Yeah.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.100
One that is very close to my heart is SETI, Breakthrough Listen, ET signal search. So

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:10.320
find extraterrestrial signals in the data from deep space. That's pretty cool. The prize is not huge,

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:15.940
but you know, if you were the person that discovered aliens, come on, I mean, that's a pretty good prize.

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:20.220
And that's just zooming back to where this conversation started. Like I said, I'm not the

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:25.440
person who could think of these ideas. And now I'm given this large number of options,

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:31.440
whatever is exciting to me. I can jump on that competition. Even if I have zero idea about how

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.900
to approach that problem, there'll be plenty of stuff that shared there. And I can just go from

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.700
there. I can just start learning. I can just try to approach this in a top down fashion.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:44.660
Yeah, absolutely. So another one of your blog posts that you wrote is your first Kaggle competition

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:49.820
experience, writing basically retrospective on that. So maybe tell us what that was like.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:54.400
Sure. So in this competition, and I tend to set these goals every year. So I just

00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:00.120
announce my goals, go big or go home, right? I just tweet out the craziest stuff that I couldn't imagine.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:04.460
Last year, I wanted to lose 50 pounds. I managed to lose 70 pounds.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.900
Congratulations. That's massive.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:12.220
Thank you. But yeah, I just set these goals. And one of these goals was to start on competing on Kaggle.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:18.520
So in this competition, my first one ever, and all of these competitions are a similar experience. I just

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:24.180
joined the quick draw doodle competition because again, it looked exciting to me. What I did at that

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:29.620
time was just went to the discussion. I found people sharing stuff, sharing code. I just took that,

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:34.640
tweaked a few numbers, tweaked a few parameters, didn't make much sense. And I started moving up

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.940
the leaderboard. So the leaderboard is the most exciting and most addicting thing on Kaggle because

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:44.920
you're getting this real-time feedback. Okay, I'm doing better than these people. And then you go to bed,

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:51.620
you wake up, someone has shared a tip or a trick somewhere in a kernel or a discussion. And now

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.800
everyone has used that. And by the time you wake up, you're down by a hundred positions.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:29:00.780
I see. They're like, oh, you're all just training all the data. What if you use like transfer learning

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:05.160
on this little subset? This is actually totally crushing it. Everybody's like, we're changing

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.780
what we're doing. And you wake up and you fall on down the leaderboard massively, huh?

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.460
Exactly. And again, now you have to get back to work.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:16.680
One thing you talked about in your blog posts was how going through it, you got some pretty good

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:22.380
real world experience, right? You talked about how you, where were you talking about? You talked about

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:29.040
how you took all the training data and the data is a lot for this competition. There's like a billion

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:35.960
images described as a CSV file or something weird like that in each image. And so you took all that

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:42.380
data, loaded the training data, not all the data, and loaded it up and sent it over on your GPU. And it

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:49.400
took 50 hours, like more than two days. And you expected you're going to crush it, right? And it turns out

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:53.580
that like, actually that made it less accurate, right? So you had to get more creative. Maybe tell

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.100
us about that.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:59.020
Yeah. And again, this was this disconnect that I found in from these MOOCs that I was coming from

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:03.760
with everything is just structured so nicely that it's supposed to work. And I just took that approach.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.440
Okay. I'm just going to check all of the data in a data loader, put it on my GPU related train and

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:14.960
I'll get a good accuracy. It turns out not really because it's not how this problem was structured. And again,

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:19.820
I learned about all of these, I think from a practitioner's perspective, important things

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:24.600
where I learned, Hey, I need to structure my project in a way, because at some point I'll be

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:30.460
an untitled 152.ipython notebook and I need to go back. I wouldn't have a track of that.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:35.700
I should probably do smaller experiments rather than the first one being a 50 hour long experiment.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.440
So I should try and figure out how to run it on a subset of the data.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:44.820
Yeah. That's a really good point because if you're waiting 50 hours per iteration, that's not going to go

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.420
very quickly.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:50.780
It sounds very easy and very obvious, but it wasn't to me at least. Maybe I was stupid at that point.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:56.480
Well, no, I wouldn't say necessarily that. I mean, it probably seemed like, well, of course, if it's working

00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:00.840
a little bit, let's just give it all the data, then it's going to really work. Right. That's a pretty reasonable,

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:08.200
naive beginner point of view that that's going to be totally fine. But then in reality, you know, reality comes

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:13.200
along. Well, it's more complicated. So you ended up coming with a combination of like some of the

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.820
larger images, some of the smaller images and building up out of like that kind of stuff.

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:23.220
Right. Yeah. So I learned that, hey, maybe I should start with 1% of the training data, put up a baseline

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:28.200
again, obvious stuff, and then try to work with different image sizes. And what I was trying to do

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:33.260
is see if the accuracy, according to my local validation was going up and submitting it to the

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:38.500
leaderboards and just checking if it's actually working and then training bigger models through

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:43.080
that. At that point, Resonate was, I think, state of the art. That's what I was sticking to,

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.600
because I didn't have any outside idea about that. Other people were, of course, doing a lot of things

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:52.600
that I was just saying, I was just saying, do catch up. Sure. This portion of Talk Python to

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:58.180
me is brought to you by YourBase. YourBase has a really cool product that will dramatically improve

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:04.520
testing and CI of your Python applications. If you could benefit from having pytest run your test 100

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:10.080
times faster or more, you need to check them out. Here's how it works. YourBase observes what tests

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:14.680
interact with which part of your application code. And the first time you run it, the speed is roughly the

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:21.000
same as normal. But the next time you run pytest is where the magic is. YourBase knows which parts of

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.940
your application code has changed. If the code under test hasn't changed, why test it again? So YourBase

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:32.380
only runs the tests that have interacted with the part of the code that has. If you change just a couple

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:37.620
of functions, you only need to run the few relevant tests and all the others can be safely skipped.

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:43.740
This means skipping hundreds or even thousands of tests most of the time, making your dev test

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:50.740
workflow and your CI builds much, much faster. All you have to do is install YourBase and run pytest as usual.

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:57.220
They'll take it from there. Get your free trial by visiting talkpython.fm/yourbase. YourBase test

00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:02.540
acceleration works with the tools you're already using. So give them a pip install and see the difference right away.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.860
Get started at talkpython.fm/yourbase.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:13.300
So you're a fan of Kaggle. You recommend people come along and use this for concrete ways to

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.940
get started and build their knowledge beyond just theoretical stuff?

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:23.000
100%. I would just say in retrospect, I would just tell myself to, hey, do fast, hey, sincerely once and

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.700
then just sign up for any competition and go from there.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.880
Is it better to do it with a team of people? Do it by yourself?

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:34.280
I'll be honest. Sometimes I would not be the person working the hardest in the team. So

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:39.980
I would tell myself to at least start solo and then team up with different people. Everyone follows

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.540
different approaches, but at least for me, I tend to be the lazy person. So I would

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:48.580
make sure that I've done some homework because before asking other people to join the team.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:53.140
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. But apart from that, when you join your team and all of my

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:58.540
Kaggle quote unquote successes, I would credit it to all of the teams I've been a part of. And then you

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:04.220
get to meet all of these data scientists in a team where they're from different levels of experience and

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:09.260
they're doing these things that I couldn't have imagined. It's again, a greater learning experience

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:09.920
in that sense.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:15.620
Yeah. What's the story in terms of people who are in the talk, you talked about them being

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:19.140
grandmasters or whatever they're called. Yeah. There's grandmasters, masters, experts,

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:25.180
contributors, and novices in the ranking here. What's the job story look like? The career

00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:33.000
story. So if I'm over here and I'm one of the 1,500 masters in Kaggle, like dropping that

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.840
information at a job interview, is that going to get me somewhere or not? Do you think?

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:43.860
It depends on the company a lot. So when I say the company where I work, H2O.com has a lot of

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:49.900
taglers. We have 20 grandmasters. I think out of the five we can see right now, three are a part of

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:50.280
H2O.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:54.000
Oh my gosh. Yeah, that's like 10% of all of them. That's awesome.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.720
Oh, sorry. Four in the top five are a part of H2O at this point. Three of them, sorry.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:58.880
Yeah, amazing.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:03.640
So such a place, they of course recognize the fact that this isn't easy. If you're a master,

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:09.620
you're probably already in the top one, top 0.5% of the global rankings. And there's a lot of work

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:14.840
behind that. So I think it does make a lot of sense. Some companies don't recognize it. Maybe

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.960
I wouldn't want to work at those companies. Again, hot take.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:22.600
Yeah, that's actually an interesting point, isn't it? Like if the person interviewing you for a data

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:27.720
science position doesn't know about Kaggle and respect like massive progress there, maybe you don't

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:33.460
want to really be on that team. Unless you're like, we're hiring you to like modernize this and set

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:38.720
the stage and like bring like the real stuff to us. But if it's like, join the team, we'll show you how

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.440
it's done. It's like, eh, you don't know what Kaggle is. Okay.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:47.100
It's just a portfolio of projects. You can tell everyone that, hey, I worked on this problem that

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:54.040
your company is working on. And against the best of the best, I ran say 10 out of 1000. And that's,

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.200
that should be a huge signal to the hiring people. I agree. I think, you know, put aside

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:03.400
the competition, put aside the, how do you rank against other people? If you can come over here

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:08.840
and say, oh, you see this major league baseball digital engagement thing? I did that and it came

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:14.060
out pretty well, actually solved that problem. And here's my GitHub repo for that and our conversations

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:20.060
around it. This one about the prediction of future sales also did that. And then this home price one,

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:27.200
actually I was near the top of that, like just having that kind of portfolio to share as part of

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:33.100
an interview is so incredibly important. So many people ask me, I want to get a job in this thing.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:40.300
How do I get started? Do I need degree X or should I go learn this technology or that technology? Like

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:46.620
all those things are interesting and valuable, but being something I really like about the tech industry,

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:51.280
but it's also, you know, it's a challenging cause that's kind of where you got to live is it's not

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:55.980
so much your credentials or your background that will get you the opportunities. It's I need somebody

00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:00.840
that does this. I need somebody that knows how to predict house prices. You predicted house prices.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:05.720
You've shown, you can do it. You're hired, right? Like if you can show that you're doing the thing that

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:10.140
they already need, there's not a whole large discussion going on after that, right? You're

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:14.720
really close to being in the right place to do that thing. So building up this portfolio

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:19.860
is important. I think I managed to somewhat figure this out in my university days out of an interest

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:25.120
just to explore problems that I started freelancing, which was because I wasn't allowed to have a job

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:30.360
job while being in university. And at that point I figured out, Hey, if I'm going to approach a person

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:36.140
on let's say Upwork and they want me to build something, I shouldn't be starting after we've had that

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:42.580
conversation. If I can just look at the problem, even put together the most basic structure around

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:46.820
it. And I can show it to them that, Hey, I put this together in two days. If you hire me, I can

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:52.100
build this in X amount of days. And most of the times that got me through the clients or whatever

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:57.100
deals I've got in that world. Yeah. And getting that first or second project under your belt.

00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:01.820
It's really important. I feel like Kaggle is part of that. Also, you know, Upwork is interesting that

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:07.860
you bring that up. I I'm a fan of Upwork. If I was starting out and trying to get my first project,

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:13.020
my first job, and I was having a hard time in my local area of finding that I'd certainly consider

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:17.180
looking and seeing what jobs are out there in Upwork, even if I thought they didn't pay very

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:23.800
well, or I didn't totally want them just having that one or two projects done. And part of my resume,

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:29.120
then you can start looking, you know, more broadly. And it's just going to be such a help to have some

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:34.960
kind of portfolio. Right. So as a student, I have the pay really didn't matter. It was a lot as a

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:41.040
student, but my biggest promotion in life was going from that basic food menu to looking up

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:47.300
that menu as I started making money. That was exciting. It almost felt illegal that he, someone

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:52.700
is paying me to write code. Yeah. I remember my first job. I was so super excited. It almost didn't

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.700
matter what they could have paid minimum wage and I would have been thrilled about it because,

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:59.680
oh my gosh, someone's paying me to learn programming. And look, I have a book. I'm

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.420
spending half my time just learning how to do this. I mean, they're basically paying me to learn this

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:08.960
stuff. It's amazing. So yeah, I really, really had the same feeling when I was getting started.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:14.580
Fantastic. All right. So another interesting area around what you're doing has to do with your

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:19.900
podcast. So maybe we could talk about just a couple of your, a couple of your interviews that

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:21.820
you've done that you really liked, right? Sure.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.680
You found interesting. So tell us a bit about a couple of them.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:28.760
Sure. So at some point how this started was I was doing all of these, I was trying to

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.740
essentially explore different areas of content creation. I started with blogging,

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:38.300
fast AI, gurus, Jeremy Howard told us to write blog posts. So I started doing that.

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:43.300
And at some point I found this disconnect of advices. So I reached out to a friend that,

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:48.500
Hey, would you, you've been helping me a lot. Is it okay if I put this together in a blog post

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:52.760
and put it out in the world? And that went on for a while. I started this as a blog series.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:58.420
And later after I graduated, I thought, okay, maybe if I do this as a podcast and I'm sure

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:04.060
you would agree, I could explore all of these great people's mind in a bigger depth. So that's

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.440
how the podcast started for me.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:10.080
Yeah. Well, one of the big secrets about having a podcast is I get to be the first

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:14.200
listener basically to all these interviews, right? I mean, I guess now that we're live streaming,

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.880
it would have like 50 first listeners or something, whatever it turns out to be. But

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:23.100
it's really amazing the opportunity to just meet these people that you're really interested in,

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:27.500
especially with conferences being gone and stuff. Now that's really hard to find time to like meet

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:31.740
up and just talk about them, but Hey, you can have them as a guest on your show. It's really nice.

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:36.740
Exactly. So coming back to my favorite interviews, I try to interview people about their journey.

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:42.500
As someone who's trying to understand how did this great person, Radek Osmalski, we have Radek

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:48.500
Osmalski's interview on top. He's one of my heroes from Fast AI. But how did someone like him learn

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:53.920
programming? How did they learn how to Kaggle? How did they break into the field? And we, at least in

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.780
the interviews, I try to ask them, did you face this problem? How did you overcome it?

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:04.960
My three favorite interviews would be Radek's, Dima Domains and Rada. So I try to interview people who

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:09.720
are Kagglers, practitioners and researchers, essentially anyone I can find who would like

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:13.060
to share their journey. And these are from all three aspects, essentially.

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:19.620
That's cool. Dima, Damon, she did video recognition and computer vision. That sounds super interesting.

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:24.540
I remember in her interview, I started by asking her, Hey, when you were doing your research,

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:30.340
you were just using OpenCV. What do you think about it nowadays? Apart from that, it's also a lot about

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:35.540
her research perspective. So Dima is very much experienced and is a great orator as well. So

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:41.800
she was talking about how to approach your first research project or how to just go about research.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.720
What is even research as someone who doesn't understand what that word means? And that's

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.500
what I try to explore in all of these interviews.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:52.100
Yeah. So let's go back to Kaggle for just a minute, because something you touched on is really

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:59.720
interesting. I know there are a lot of research teams and groups at universities who are trying to

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:05.800
build models or trying to build mathematical algorithms or trying to do research. I feel like

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:10.860
maybe some of these Kaggle competitions would be really, really good to say, as part of our research

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:15.420
project, let's take what we're trying to develop here and try to actually apply it to one of these

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:17.160
competitions and see where it stands.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:21.380
For sure. And it's highly encouraged, at least in the community, some organizers,

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:28.160
so the sponsors of the competition invite you to present your solution even in research conferences.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:33.500
And apart from that, even if you end up creating a blog post or a research paper outside of

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:38.900
the community is very close and they recognize it instantly. And they know that, I mean, nothing

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:44.040
against research, but at least this particular solution has been tried and tested against this

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:48.460
leaderboard and it works really well. It is quite cutting edge because it's been tested against all

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.120
of these people.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:53.780
Yeah. Yeah. Very neat. All right. Third one that you had queued up for us is Andrada

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:54.700
Altianu.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:55.700
Altianu. Yeah.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:56.900
Altianu. Yeah.

00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:01.640
The best part about these interviews is I just get to meet all of these people with such amazing

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:07.260
energy and such openness about their journey. This was again, such a fun interview because Andrada was

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:12.260
so open about her journey. I was at that point, I was just starting my journey in data visualization.

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:22.500
And I asked her, Hey Andrada, did you feel the same that you couldn't plot things against X and Y axis and then you would have a hard time figuring out where they are ending up? Because at least for me,

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:31.580
I couldn't understand what's going on. And that's what we discussed about. And she was essentially talking about how she started her journey as someone who's fairly new to coding.

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:42.140
And at this point, she's become a Kaggle Grandmaster in kernels and she's been writing all of these amazing notebooks. And in this interview, we just learned about how she went about that as someone who,

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:45.240
just started out and then learned all about this as they went about.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:50.460
Yeah. That looks like a really interesting interview and somewhat similar to the one that a conversation we're having here, right?

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.280
I think so. Yes.

00:43:51.280 --> 00:44:09.700
Yeah. Yeah. All right. One final area that I want to make sure we get to spend some time on is, you know, you work at H2O.ai. I've had a lot of experience with these different frameworks. Maybe we could do like a survey of the various deep learning ML libraries and you could sort of tell me how they compare and your thoughts on the various ones.

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:12.120
Sure. So the vision set for,

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:22.860
both by our founder, co-founder and CEO is makers going to make. And what we're trying to do on a philosophical level is just create products that allow people to build stuff.

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:48.420
So with that vision, and this is just my take on it, not from a company's perspective, they've built together all of these auto ML products. So Wave being the latest one, I'm sure we'll talk about this. But apart from that, they started out with the open source H2O3, which was an auto ML framework. It's still one of the most widely used ones. Followed by driverless CI, which is an end-to-end auto ML product where essentially you just upload your data.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:58.840
And what I like to call the Ironman mode where you just click a button, it figures out what models need to be trained, does all the feature engineering and puts out a nice model for you.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:08.060
So we have this arsenal of auto ML products. At this point, open source and both enterprise facing aimed at different problems. Wave being the latest one of them.

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:26.860
Yeah. Wave, H2O Wave is pretty interesting. I guess it's at wave.h2o.ai. And it's a real-time web app dashboard for Python and data science. And a lot of the data science things I see are about making static graphs or maybe graphs that you can go and explore.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:42.660
Like I could move my mouse over and it'll like highlight information about different parts that I could zoom into it and whatnot. But this is like a real-time changing dashboard, like a stock market or like a factory or something like that. You want to see what's happening as time passes, right?

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.020
I wish you said crypto market.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:58.840
Yes, exactly. So the reason I spoke about the philosophy is because I think this is the next bigger goal for the company. What we're trying to create is, I'm not sure if this is out yet or not. We're trying to build a public app store of AI apps.

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:20.080
So Wave is an open source framework that takes care of a lot of the things that as a data scientist, at least I wouldn't want to worry about. I don't want to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript. So it's just a framework that takes care of all of the UI, UX stuff, does it very nicely. I don't have to worry about messing up because it's taken care of. And then I can build different AI apps.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:30.960
As a company, what we're trying to do is we're also putting out an app store where you can already use the open source apps if you want. And you can also contribute your own apps if you want.

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:47.860
Yeah, very cool. So there's a bunch of cool examples. There's a whole gallery full of many, many different things that you can go and write. Basically, Wave is a open source dashboard for Python developers that don't have to do web stuff, but they can share it as the web, right? On a website.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:47:08.000
Exactly. And just to be clear for the audience, when I say we, my biggest contribution would probably be this interview. But again, it's this amazing team of engineers who have been building these products at H2O that they know how to scale them and how to properly engineer them through all of this experience. It's really a data scientist-focused product.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:18.900
Every now and then there's like a project I'm like, or something out there. I'm like, I really wish I had a reason to use this. This looks like really fun to play with. I just have no use for it personally. This is one of those things, right?

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:27.540
I would love to have an excuse to use something like this and make it go, but I just don't have that much data that changes that much in my world.

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:36.560
Maybe you could together a web page of Talk Python where different episodes structure themselves and the listeners can see a dashboard in real time. Just a suggestion.

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:42.680
That would be cool. Like maybe downloads in real time and interaction in real time, comments. Yeah, for sure. Something like that.

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:42.940
Yeah.

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:57.880
Yeah. I mean, I could definitely like put a little bit of something, but if you worked at a place that like had a lot of stuff going on, like a factory or like a big e-commerce site or something, you could make a really cool live app out of this stuff, I feel like.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:09.160
For sure. And again, it's still under development and all of our grandmasters who have this rich experience are also contributing to it. So I'm sure by the time this interview goes out, we would have added a lot to it.

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:30.520
Yeah, it's cool. It's already got 2.6,000 GitHub stars. That's pretty cool. So really, really nice. Maybe let's talk about some of the other mainstream ones as well, like Keras, TensorFlow, Fast AI. Give us your thoughts on these different frameworks. Obviously, it's your opinion, not like a, you know, endorsement or a deep dive or whatever. But just what do you think about these people or don't necessarily have experience with all of them?

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:38.580
Yeah. Just to be clear, I strongly endorse Fast AI. I've been a fan of that. That I'll agree on. But from that, I started my journey with TensorFlow.

00:48:38.580 --> 00:49:05.480
TensorFlow, at least in that day, of course, TensorFlow has come along with the Keras API has been merged. But I was really struggling because it had this static graph structure and it didn't feel Pythonic. Not that I was a good Python programmer. I'm still not. So that's why to Fast AI and what Keras is to TensorFlow, Fast AI is somewhat to PyTorch. PyTorch follows this more Pythonic approach and Fast AI is a wrapper, but more on top of PyTorch.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:10.060
Okay, interesting. Yeah. So Fast AI is maybe a little easier to get started with, you think?

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:40.040
Yeah. So the nice thing about Fast AI is a very heavily opinionated library. So there are a lot of things that have been baked into it. And for some reason, whenever I just switch to PyTorch, I am not able to replicate similar accuracies. That's what I mean, because somewhere defaults are so good that it always gets better results. But essentially, it's this layered API. And from an end user perspective, I could just use the high level API where they have on the left, you can, if you click on applications, you can see the difference.

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:50.260
Applications that they support. Or if I want to work on something that's cutting edge, I can also use the training loop, which is really nice, and just bring in a PyTorch model and connect that.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:50:11.260
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that looks really cool. Again, computer vision. I want to build a computer game AI that plays me in real life. Like put a camera over, say, a chess board, and it'll play me, but not just on the screen. As I actually move the things, right, it'll see. That'd be fun. Maybe I can try that out here.

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.300
Sounds very cool. Yeah.

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:23.340
Yeah, just a little bit of interaction with some real something or other there. That sounds cool. But a lot of options these days, right? And we've got all these different people in libraries and many things to choose from, right?

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:51.380
Again, one of the things that I've learned, at least from the podcast, and this is the collective opinion of everyone I've interviewed, again, you don't need to worry about the framework as much as you really understand the concepts. So that's why I encourage FastHair, because it's also a course around the framework. So once, at least from my perspective, when I've gotten around to learning all of these things, it shouldn't be that hard to switch to another framework, depending on whatever your job requires you to do or whatever your project needs you to use.

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:58.860
Yeah. Well, yeah, you learn the foundation, solve the problem one way, and then you can solve it with some other library more easily again and again.

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:12.380
It's really hard for me to remind myself that, hey, the problem is what I'm trying to solve and not create more problems. I don't want to learn more of different things, but I need to figure out how to minimize my time in a way that I actually solve the problem.

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:30.760
Yeah. I think one interesting thing that people learn as they get more experience is, even if the technology is super different, right? If I learned how to build something interesting in JavaScript, maybe I know nothing about Python, so how am I going to do that? But actually, what you've learned over in one place is really way more transferable and reusable.

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:41.380
Like the way of just thinking about solving problems, the way of thinking about, okay, I got to pay attention to this and not that. So what's important in this library, picking the right library are these things and so on.

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:51.680
And of course, you should keep switching between frameworks as well. The thing for me was I was switching as a very early stage developer. I'm still a very early stage, if I can even call myself a developer.

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:59.200
And I was switching between frameworks every 15 days just because they looked exciting. That's not the right thing I would tell myself to do.

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:18.240
Yeah, this is true. This is true. Get comfortable in one and then you can move around. But yeah, don't just chase the shiny thing all over the place for sure. Although in the data science world, there's so many shiny new things that there are to pay attention to and visualizations and libraries and charting and graphing and whatnot. It's easy to get distracted, I think.

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:26.660
For sure. And that's why I mentioned I need to remember what I'm working on. So I need to make the graph and not figure out how to make it prettier as long as it does what it's supposed to do.

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:32.000
But that framework looks exciting. Maybe I should try that over the weekend and now I'm spending 15 days.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.900
More like here's an excuse to try that framework. This is my chance to try it. So I'm going to go do it.

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:37.340
Exactly.

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:49.960
Exactly. Well, all right. Comment on the live stream. Davinas says, hey, some advice on getting started on web development or data science, you know, Python. I'll throw out a little bit then you can add your thoughts.

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:50.200
Sure.

00:52:50.200 --> 00:53:14.360
I would say you need to have some foundation in just Python basics, right? You need to know variables, loops, functions, like that kind of stuff. But don't kind of like the beginning conversation we had. Don't go so deep and say, well, I've got to completely understand everything about this language before I take the step to my first web app or before I take the step to like firing up Jupyter and doing my first analysis.

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:24.800
Like, don't do that. You know, just get comfortable with the basics. Start building. And as you go into more advanced areas, then you're like, OK, well, now I kind of need to learn about what is a list comprehension.

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:48.700
Michael, but first question for you. What are the basics? Really? That's one thing I really struggle with. I still struggle with because I look around on Twitter. Everyone smarter than me is talking about this stuff. And this is pretty basic. Is it? Am I the stupid person who needs to know all of this?

00:53:48.700 --> 00:54:09.200
Well, here is the interesting thing. Like the people who are blogging, the people who are recording YouTube videos or people who are tweeting about things, they're already at like some certain level. And then they're super psyched about something advanced that they've just learned or some really cool scalability thing that they've learned.

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:25.820
And there's a really good article says titled something like you're not Instagram, you're not Google, you're not LinkedIn or something. So you don't need all these crazy design patterns and this like crazy cloud architecture that companies like that have because you're a two person startup that doesn't even yet have a business.

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:47.560
Build something simple. And I think there's a lot of people that are fascinated by either looking up, like, look where we could go and look at what Instagram is doing, look at what Google is doing. And they are amazing and interesting what those companies and teams are doing, but they don't apply to you now.

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:57.300
You know what I mean? So I think there's just a lot of really interesting conversations about stuff that's interesting, but not applicable to people who are beginners at all. Right.

00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:57.760
Exactly.

00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:10.740
You need to master Dockers and Kubernetes. Probably not. Can you run it on your computer? Yes. Okay. Then start there. We'll worry about Docker. Like once you get something working, maybe we'll put it in a container. But now, don't worry about that now. Get started.

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:36.300
Exactly. And just to the person asking this question, focus on getting the website up and give yourself a deadline. That's why I love setting goals publicly. Give yourself 10-20 days to figure out the Python basics and put together first website. You won't like it. In retrospect, you might hide it from a GitHub. I do that a lot. And over time, you'll polish it. It doesn't have to look like, like you said, Facebook or Instagram when it comes out.

00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:51.020
It just needs to function somewhat. And sometimes you'll click a button, something will fail. But then you figure out that, okay, I need to fix this now. And now you have stuff to do. And then you can think of other things. Okay, maybe I should add this. Maybe I should add a button. You're making progress already.

00:55:51.020 --> 00:56:02.100
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And the other thing to keep in mind is that software is plastic. It's malleable. It can be changed. You don't have to get it right the first time. You have to just make progress.

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:21.260
You've learned more than you change it and you make more progress. And so many people can get hung up, like not even getting started because like, well, I'm not really sure how to get started. Like, just take a step. If it's wrong, you take a step in a slightly different direction until you get in the right place. Like that's how you do it without getting hung up, without trying to boil the ocean by learning everything.

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:21.720
Exactly.

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:35.020
All right. Maybe that's a good place to leave it there for that conversation. But yeah, it's super interesting to hear your story. And congratulations on the success coming from getting started with small projects in college to working for H2O AI.

00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:55.340
I'm still learning a lot. But again, thanks so much for this opportunity. Like I said, I think there are two types of teachers. First, that they introduce you to something and the second that make you really interested in it. You were the second one to me because I just got so excited about all of these things through your podcast. And of course, there were others as well, but you were a major part of it. And yeah, thanks for this opportunity.

00:56:55.340 --> 00:57:03.280
Oh, yeah. Thanks so much. Now you're not out of here yet, though. You got to answer the two final questions. If you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use?

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.120
Jupyter notebook.

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:12.380
Okay, yeah, right on. And then is there some library or something on PyPI you've come across recently? You're like, oh, this is super cool. Got to tell people about this.

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:18.820
I keep running into all of them every second day. But I would say just discovering fast AI was the biggest wow moments for me.

00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:24.140
Yeah. All right. So fast AI. Perfect. That's a good one. All right. Final call to action. People are interested.

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:30.060
They're maybe also listening, getting into programming, getting into data science. And what advice do you have for them?

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:45.800
Just build something or just go to Kaggle if you can't figure out what project to work on. I still struggle with that inspiration a lot. So I just, I would just tell myself to go to Kaggle and sign up for any competition that I like the most and go from there. Probably take fast AI along the way and you're all set.

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:49.540
All right. Fantastic. Well, thanks so much for being here and catch you later.

00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:50.580
Thanks so much.

00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:51.240
Yeah. Bye.
