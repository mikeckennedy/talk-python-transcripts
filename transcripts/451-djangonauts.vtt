Are you interested in contributing to Django?

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:07.680
There is an amazing mentorship program that helps Python and Django enthusiasts

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.520
become contributors and potentially core developers of Django.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.180
It's called DjangoNauts, and their slogan is,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.680
Where Contributors Launch.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.720
On this episode, we have Sarah Boyce from the Django team

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.860
and former DjangoNaut and now DjangoNaut mentor, Tushar Gupta.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.240
Not only is this project excellent for the Django community,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.280
many open source communities would do well to keep an eye

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.160
on how this creative project is going.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.680
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 451, recorded January 10th, 2024.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.980
Hello, hello.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.800
Hey, Sarah.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.420
Hey, Tashar.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.880
Welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.500
Hello.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.160
So good to have you both on the show.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.580
You know, when I saw the Django Knots project, I think it was Brian Okken that had found it

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.440
and started talking about it on Python Bytes initially.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.700
I'm like, oh, that is a brilliant idea.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.440
I definitely, definitely need to talk to the people behind it.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.940
So, so glad to have you both here.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.760
You both are playing multiple roles in this whole process, which is fantastic.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.580
So excited to dive into the Django Knots.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.120
Amazing.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.620
I actually remember when that came up and we were all got excited and we're like,

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.000
how on earth did they find us?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.660
So really cool.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.880
That entire show is just about finding stuff that's interesting like that,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.300
that maybe doesn't get a light shown on it and shining that light.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.140
So awesome.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.520
Glad, happy we're able to do it.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.380
And we'll do it a little bit more today.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.760
We'll make it the whole topic.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.180
How's that?

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.640
Awesome.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.600
Yeah, indeed.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.200
Now, before we dive into all that, let's just start with your story.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.900
And what, how do you do programming?

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.520
What do you do these days?

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.520
Sarah, let's start with you.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.040
Okay.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.440
Yeah.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.280
So I am a Django developer.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.920
That's probably not surprising.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.280
I've been doing that pretty much my entire developer career.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.560
It's about five years.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:34.220
And about a year, two years ago, I started getting involved in open source contributions

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.920
to Django core.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.860
And now I'm part of the review and triage team, which is a fancy name for saying like

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.360
active core Django contributor group or something like that.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.920
And yeah, why I'm here today is now we've got the mentorship program that I co-organize.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.840
Yeah, it's amazing.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.720
What kind of apps do you work on?

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.820
Have you worked on in Django?

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.220
Like, are you building APIs or what are you building?

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.240
Yeah, good question.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.280
So originally I was pretty much full stack Django experience with Django templates.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:15.520
And then I changed companies and then it was with a React front end and a Django REST framework

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.580
API backend, which is perhaps quite a typical setup really.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.480
And I've changed again.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.800
And now I'm a developer advocate for JetBrains.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.780
So I no longer have to maintain a web application.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.380
So yeah, that's me.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.940
Yeah, the dev relationship can't go down at night, right?

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.020
You're not going to get woken up on a weekend because somebody upgraded the database and now

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.120
your app doesn't work anymore.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.500
Now, I'm a huge fan of JetBrains and what they're doing.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.900
And that must be a fun place to work, I imagine.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.720
Yeah, indeed.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.280
Tushar, how about you?

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.880
Hi, everyone.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.220
So I'm Tushar Gupta.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.300
I'm from India.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.900
And I have recently graduated.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.400
I graduated in 2023.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.500
So that was my first undergrad course.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.340
And I currently work as a software engineer at Samagla Governance and where we deal with problems related to Indian governments.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.800
So we work alongside the Indian government and create solutions that helps them govern better.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.900
That's my day job.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.540
And I've been involved with open source from my sophomore year.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:27.340
That was the place like I was quite shocked seeing, wow, there are people who are there to help you for free.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.500
And you get so high quality code reviews just for free.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.220
So like, yeah, it was a full package for me.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.340
And I got into some fellowships.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.460
And one of the fellowships, I'm not sure if you've heard of it, was Major League Hacking.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.040
They ran a fellowship.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.300
And in there, I got introduced to Django and to Carlton as well.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.340
And I think from there, only Django Nords got me as one of the contributors trying to get into the code.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.360
And they reached out for the pilot program.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.440
So, yeah, that's me.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.800
And now I'm here.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.840
Oh, wonderful.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.820
So you said you just recently started working as a software developer professionally.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.600
Is that right?

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.840
Yeah.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.200
How are you liking it?

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.440
I think it's pretty good.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.900
I've been always amazed with how much I can do with my laptop.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.080
And now that you have a job, which also kind of lets you create some real impact.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:23.120
I can literally see students in public schools using our apps, using our APIs to get better at their normal courses.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.620
So, yeah, it's been a complete amazing experience.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.440
It's definitely fun.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.300
I think the hardest part about software development is getting your first job.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:35.280
And once you have a little bit of credibility and experience, then it's, you know, then it's kind of chasing what you're interested in.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.280
But, yeah, congratulations.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.200
That's excellent.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.640
Let's dive in.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.040
Let's blast off, huh?

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.660
Let's blast off.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.380
With the Django Nords, right?

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:50.480
And you really have leaned into this space and astronaut-ass angle here.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.580
The website is django-not.space.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.940
We have navigators and captains and Django Nords and so on.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.040
So, yeah, very fun.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.240
Very playful, I think.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.160
And that's, on one hand, it's like whatever, what difference does it make.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.180
On the other, I think it makes a difference, right?

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.560
Especially for people who are getting more into programming.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.880
Like, it should sound fun because it is fun.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.560
But, you know, I think it just draws people in.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.500
It certainly did me when I heard about it, like I said.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.880
Awesome.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.940
Yeah.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.500
So, Sarah, I'll let you introduce this whole program.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.420
It's pretty neat.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.880
Tell us about it.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:33.100
There's been a need for more mentorship within the Django kind of open source community for some time.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:42.440
And we have already participated in some other programs like the Major League Hacking and Google Summer of Code.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.420
But sometimes we don't always retain people.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.760
We have variable success.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.620
And there are still a bunch of people who appear in our, like, help channels.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.960
And they're always like, oh, I'm interested in mentorship.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.740
Please help me.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.240
How do I get started, et cetera.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.240
And it felt like there could be more that we could be doing there.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:08.620
This topic of we need a mentorship program, we need a mentorship program, came up a number of times.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:16.100
And eventually we launched Django Not Space as our answer to that kind of need.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:21.600
We took heavy inspiration from the Kubernetes ladder program.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.860
So, the Kubernetes community also has their own contributor mentorship program.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:36.060
And that had, like, the concept of cohorts, for example, which we've very much borrowed and things like this.

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:41.460
So, what we wanted to do was to design something that could be quite lightweight and sustainable.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:51.960
As we want to respect everybody's time that's involved and kind of appreciate that the open source experience is a little bit in and out.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.920
And you will.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.260
And that's kind of normal also.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:05.720
So, anyway, what we are kind of iterating on is we now have a eight-week program, which actually the next program starts on Monday.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:11.560
So, we're just about getting everybody excited and together for that right now.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.380
And in the program, we have Django Nots.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.900
This is our term for mentees, like the participants of the program.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:26.600
And they will be assigned a navigator in, like, a team.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:32.000
So, there's about a team of three mentees or Django Nots with one navigator.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:45.560
The navigator is a person who has open source contributor experience and some kind of background that they can use to, like, answer questions and all this kind of stuff.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:52.060
Do they have to be a Django core developer or do you have to be even a contributor to Django?

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:56.500
Or do they, you know, if I was saying, I worked on Flask and I was really awesome at it.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.300
But I also want to help these folks over here.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.760
I'm really good at open source, but not so much Django contributor yet.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.200
So, we have expanded the program.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.580
So, in the pilot, it was originally just Django core that we were focusing on.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.400
And now we have navigators that have a focus on other packages.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:22.400
So, for example, Tim Schilling is one of the maintainers of Django Debug Toolbar.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.840
And Mark Walker is, I think, he's the tech lead of Django CMS.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:33.060
And so, we are kind of incorporating that.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:43.840
We want to build a contributor base to the Django ecosystem as a whole because all of the packages really do help and support Django.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:50.740
It's part of the real core value of Django as a framework is the other open source packages that are around it.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.380
And who knows whether we will expand even further later on.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:02.060
But I think really the thing that's key is having a little bit of open source experience.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.740
And to be honest, a lot of it is transferable.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.840
So, a little bit around etiquette for reviews.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.080
Like, don't at people all the time and all this kind of stuff.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.920
At channel.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.020
I need some help.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.620
Things like that.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.420
We then have one other role, which is the captain.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:24.140
And they add another layer of support to the program.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:29.120
So, these are kind of like a supportive pastoral role.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:36.500
And they have more one-to-one sessions with the Django Nuts to get to know them, check that they're okay.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:44.820
And if there was anything that kind of they wanted to talk about, but they didn't feel comfortable, mention it in a larger group.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.620
So, we do have a Discord chat.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:52.860
And we also have these weekly check-ins that they have with the navigators and the team.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:12:00.640
But the captains one-to-one, if you've got something that you, perhaps you've been really poorly, and you want to talk about that.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:09.900
And anything that comes up in life that perhaps you didn't feel comfortable announcing to the world can come up with your captains.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:17.560
So, they're really there to also normalize any of the anxieties or feelings that you have around working in public.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.260
Because if this is the first time you're doing that, it's also a little bit vulnerable.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.680
So, yeah.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.480
Also, shout out to the captains.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.200
Yeah, awesome.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.900
I think that's a pretty powerful way to organize this, right?

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.860
You've got a lot of support.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:36.120
The thing that strikes me about this is it feels a little bit like a boot camp, right?

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.400
Like a coding boot camp.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.600
I'm going to just take the next three months off and dive into this.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.400
But way more lightweight than that.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:50.340
And also, I think for other people who might be thinking that, it's worth pointing out that the goal is not to teach people how to Django, right?

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.280
Yes, 100%.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:51.540
Yeah.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.280
Tishar, you want to add to that as well?

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.560
You're shaking your head there.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:54.960
Yeah.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.640
So, Django.net is not a boot camp.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.580
I think we have been getting a lot of questions around that as well.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.740
That whether it's a boot camp, whether someone will be taught how to Django.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.220
But it's not like that.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.120
It's a...

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.480
You can think of it as a program which gives you the right support, right people and right resources.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.500
In case...

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.620
If you want to contribute to the core Django or the Django ecosystem.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:24.760
So, it kind of brings in all the right people together for a short time so that you can get the needed liftoff that you want and get started with the Django.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:32.840
I guess the mental model people should have is primarily the goal here is to increase the contributors to maybe Django.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.580
Maybe as you mentioned, Sarah, a little bit broader.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.080
Like, maybe you could contribute to Tim's project.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.000
The Django debug toolbar.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.440
Just don't leave it on in production.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.760
And those types of things, right?

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:50.000
Like, in the broader ecosystem, bringing people in to contribute to Django more broadly.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.500
So, it's specifically about treating people who make those contributions.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.220
Exactly.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.100
Rather than saying, I heard that programming is cool.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.620
So, I'm going to quit my marketing job and do that.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.060
Exactly.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.040
And a thing that...

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.260
Because what is success?

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:11.860
It's such an interesting question because we get random commits from people all the time.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:18.300
And really, it's not necessarily that there aren't going to be contributors to Django.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.060
Django is quite a big package.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:24.660
People will always come and suggest things and give some code.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:30.540
It's more also around that Django has a community behind it.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:36.900
And the people who stick around longer term, they feel like they're part of that community

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:42.700
and that they're part of something a little bit bigger than just a commit in this cold,

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.100
heartless code base that's somewhere.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:52.360
And so, if we can get people to feel like, actually, there are a bunch of real, very helpful

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:57.920
people who are working on Django and other packages around it,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.020
and that you could interact with these people.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.260
And a lot of them are now my friends.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:11.040
It kind of is trying to show that there's a lot more to it and there's this value you can keep getting.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.900
And hopefully, then people will stick around.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:19.880
And I think it's more the, if you can stick around and do sustainable contributions

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.700
over a longer period of time, that builds up to something really quite huge.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.140
And I think for me, I find that really exciting.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:28.520
Yeah.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:35.500
To me, Django, more than almost any other sub-community of a programming world,

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:40.380
not Python itself, but, you know, versus, you know, Flask, Litestar, whatever.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.520
Other web frameworks, ORMs, whatever.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:50.080
It seems really to build a community around it and not just technical excellence, right?

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.940
Like, Django has a lot of technical attributes that people are attracted to.

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:59.260
I would, a lot of the Django people I talk to are attracted because of the community and the support,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.000
and they just want to be part of that thing.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:02.500
That's amazing.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.340
Yeah, I think you can see that in the Django Nord program itself.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:11.160
When I first got in, I thought, like, meeting all the core contributors face-to-face,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.900
having chats with them, and seeing problems that they face managing open source,

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:20.500
and then their actual job, and then the Django contributions, and now there's a program.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.640
So I can see how much they're putting in towards maintaining and building this community

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.020
and how much they care about it.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.360
So it gives you a good, inclusive feeling as well.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.220
And I found it really good.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:31.540
Yeah.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:37.020
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Neo4j.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.960
Do you know Neo4j?

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.700
Neo4j is a native graph database.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.560
And if the slowest part of your data access patterns involves computing relationships,

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:51.740
why not use a database that stores those relationships directly in the database,

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.800
unlike your typical relational one?

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.660
A graph database lets you model the data the way it looks in the real world,

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.500
instead of forcing it into rows and columns.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:05.880
It's time to stop asking a relational database to do more than they were made for and simplify

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.120
complex data models with graphs.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.180
If you haven't used a graph database before, you might be wondering about common use cases.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.080
You know, what's it for?

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.460
Here are just a few.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.600
Detecting fraud.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.100
Enhancing AI.

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.920
Managing supply chains.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.780
Gaining a 360 degree view of your data.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.160
And anywhere else you have highly connected data.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.620
To use Neo4j from Python, it's a simple pip install Neo4j.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:36.620
And to help you get started, their docs include a sample web app demonstrating how to use it,

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.860
both from Flask and FastAPI.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:43.740
Find it in their docs or search GitHub for Neo4j movies application quick start.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:47.920
Developers are solving some of the world's biggest problems with graphs.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.120
Now it's your turn.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.420
Visit talkpython.fm/Neo4j to get started.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:58.380
That's talkpython.fm/N-E-O, the number four, and the letter J.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.440
Thank you to Neo4j for supporting Talk Python to me.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.660
I'm sorry if I'm leaving some community out that I just don't know.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:12.420
But the only other part of Python that I feel really has it as nailed as that is the SciPy space.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:18.500
It seems like the Jupyter and the scientific computing side, there's kind of a big community there.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:24.100
You've got NumFocus that actually funds a lot of that specifically in that area.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.700
But it's pretty unique.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.520
Speaking about funding, I don't see a pricing on your page here.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.480
Like, what's the price?

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.540
Oh, I wasn't prepared enough for this question.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.840
Okay.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.960
Right.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.120
So, okay.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:44.000
If we compared ourselves to Outreachy or Google Summer of Codes,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.040
they do actually have a sponsorship where they do pay the...

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.980
It's almost like a scholarship that you're going to work on.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.980
Like an internship almost type thing, yeah.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:56.400
Exactly.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.040
A little, yeah.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:57.260
Okay.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.760
And we don't have that money.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:08.660
We have been very generously given a grant from the Django Software Foundation to help us grow this program.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.440
And we will be using that in different places in order to do that.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:19.440
But at some point, we'd like to sponsorship from companies.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:27.840
So, if you're listening and that's something that you think would be a good idea, then, you know, please get in touch with the organizers.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.840
That would be awesome.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.260
Yeah.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.200
Sarah, you should go on a podcast and let the companies know.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.240
Yeah, that's a great idea.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.280
No, well, I think that's awesome.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.240
And it would be really...

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:44.780
I do want to encourage companies out there listening to have connections back to Django or just want to get in front of Django developers for whatever reason to do that.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:45.480
That would be awesome.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.820
But it doesn't cost money to participate as a...

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.820
100% no.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:50.800
You're doing that, right?

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.660
No, no, no.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.880
I mean, yeah.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:20:04.760
Back to what Tasha said at the very start that, like, he couldn't believe that you got these amazing quality, like, PR reviews from all these experienced engineers for free.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:14.200
I think open source is this incredible resource where you can get very usable, real-life programming experience.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.340
And, yeah, generally for free.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.200
So, no, we don't charge people to be part of this.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:20.660
That's awesome.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:29.540
And you can participate in very professional type of projects without having to go through and getting a job at a fame company or whatever, right?

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.900
You're just like, I'm going to be part of this GitHub project.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:36.520
And it looks like they have continuous integration and code reviews and these experts and so on.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.080
It's very cool.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.720
It's pretty magical, open source.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.000
Tushar, so originally you were a Django not.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.880
And now you're coming back to pay it forward a little bit afterwards.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.520
So, let's start by talking about your experience going through the program.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.920
Like, what were you thinking when you signed up for it?

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.820
What was it?

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.440
And what was the day-to-day like?

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.620
And then what did you get out of it?

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.320
I think I got pretty excited when I saw this email.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:10.160
So, I got an email, I think, a few months back saying that there's a program that Django, program named Django Not, that is going to be started.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.740
It's a very small program.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.740
We are going to be in teams of three to four.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.240
And whether are you interested or not?

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.100
So, it was a complete yes for me that I'm totally interested.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.780
And I reverted back to the email.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.440
And after a few days, I got a selection email that, yeah, you are finally in.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:33.340
I also shared it with some of my juniors who are also trying to contribute to Django REST frameworks, Django Stubbs, and other projects.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.540
Here's the GitHub link of the program that is going in a pilot mode.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.460
Just go and try out.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:44.360
So, I think one of the other folks named Anwan, she also got in.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.400
He's also now joining us as a captain.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:55.460
And during my phase of the Django Not, I think the best part, the best part of this program that I've talked about a lot of times before as well,

00:21:55.460 --> 00:22:02.040
the core difference that I saw on contributing to different projects and joining in as Django Not was you were actually meeting real people.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:07.900
They were not just some GitHub usernames that you know that you just talk over technically,

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:18.720
but you can really talk with them where they live, how they look, and just get on with what got them started with the project and how they do stuff.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:25.120
So, that gave me a kind of inclusivity, a sense of belonging in the community that I know people.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:25.780
I know Sarah.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.720
I know Sarah Boyce.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.900
I know Rachel.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.160
I know a lot of people now.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:29.760
I know Tim.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:35.940
And it got me, like, it gave me some kind of motivation to just be, keep, just be involved,

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:40.060
irrespective of, like, not lose my motivation and just be with the program.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:45.320
So, during the Django Not phase, I contributed, I think, a few PRs.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.380
There's one that's on the accessibility part of Django.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.000
I think it's in a work of progress.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.140
So, it's just getting in slowly and slowly.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.980
There's some docs changes that I've done.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.020
And then there's another one that is just in preview.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:08.780
Another thing that I was getting out of Django Not was, I know there is a focused group that is communicating to me about my PRs and how I can get better reviews.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:15.660
If the reviews are getting delayed, I was getting active response on, like, the team is currently busy or maybe there's a holiday season going on.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.260
Maybe there's a new Django major release that's going on.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.600
So, the team is not getting enough time to currently review it.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.060
So, I didn't feel isolated or hosted out there.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.800
But I knew, like, there are people who are seeing this.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.520
And the whole experience was very good, meeting a lot of new people.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.660
And it was just fun.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.460
So, that's how Django Not worked for me.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.340
Yeah, excellent.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:39.960
And you're going on to become a captain for the next cohort, right?

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.800
So, you're doing the one-on-one mentorship side of things.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.100
Yeah.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:49.380
I wanted to, so I asked when the Django Not program was about to be ended, I asked Sarah.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.520
There's another Sarah.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:24:00.500
So, I asked her, like, is there any way I can still be around and, like, can this Discord group be continued or are we going to just shut it now as a programmer?

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:08.820
So, she told me that, no, we are going to have another cohort and you can come in as a Django Not captain if you want and just meet other people.

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.600
And, I mean, I was like, why not?

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.160
Yeah.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.760
Meeting a lot of new people.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.460
And there are a lot of people from the country that I am from.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:22.700
So, that got me even more excited that there were folks out there that I didn't know of and now I know them.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:23.600
So, yeah.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:23.880
Yeah.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.700
That's excellent.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:32.220
Probably you're more likely to go to conferences where there's Django people meeting and just generally be more part of the community, right?

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.500
Not just this.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.940
Yeah, I completely agree.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:40.520
I think just the part Django Not nailed completely is doing one-on-ones, video calls.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.760
It just gives you some sense of belonging.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.840
Yeah, it's great to see people one-to-one and talk with them.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.300
So, it's fun.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:48.640
Yeah.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:56.820
You always notice it that after a Django Con, so there's Django Con US and Django Con Europe happens pretty much every year.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:00.060
We just had a Django Con Africa for the first time.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:05.380
But we don't have a Django Con Asia or a Django Con South America.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:15.780
And there are regions that don't have this opportunity of a conference each year that the community really gets together and that you meet people.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:20.700
And whenever you see the conference and you see people afterwards, they're buzzing.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:27.000
And everyone's so excited to have gotten together and to really reignite that kind of community feeling.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.600
But it's not accessible to everybody.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:36.620
And it's really nice for us to try and recreate a little bit.

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:42.240
It's not the same as a Django Con, of course, but a little bit of that Django magic.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:54.980
If we can bring a little bit of that experience to a wider group of people, I think it's really special because I think, you know, that's really what Django is about for me.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.460
Yeah.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:12.620
For every person that is pretty close or pretty accessible to a local meetup or a regional conference, there are many, many people who work by themselves, live far from those places, you know, and it's these types of things are really important connection to the community that way.

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:16.000
All right, Sarah, what about time commitments?

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.500
What's the day to day look like?

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.660
12 hours a day.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.200
What do you all do?

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.020
Yeah, it's constant.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:23.780
Right.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.460
So that's one of the things we really try to design.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:33.140
Also, we have as a Django not it is self-managed and self-guided.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:39.580
So with the amount of time commitment, we're saying it's maybe four hours a week, but it can really vary.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:52.480
So if you did two hours or maybe one week, you decided that you're going to spend your whole Saturday or whatever, it can really be driven by that participant.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:59.600
We're not going to be there with a whip saying, please do more or do less.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.040
Yeah.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.280
Actually, the do less would be a concern.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:06.460
I mean, we do want to make sure that this is sustainable.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:22.940
And if we saw people, I don't know, constantly working on something without ever taking a break, then that would be something that we would want the captains and the navigator to go in and check that they're OK and that they know it's not the end of the world.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.460
And that, you know, they can take a break.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:25.740
Yeah.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:30.560
That happens to me when I get really just super into something, usually some new technology.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.340
I'll just work and work and take a break.

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:34.480
Wow, I'm hungry.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.020
Oh, it's because I haven't eaten for eight hours.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:36.780
What's going on?

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.780
But, you know, to me, like that's a it's kind of cool to get lost that way.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.820
But you shouldn't set it as an expectation.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.200
Right.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:43.660
You're like.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:44.740
Yes, exactly.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.400
And people work really differently.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:51.020
And if and if this is sustainable and it works for you and that's completely fine.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:56.400
But if it was that somebody said, oh, I will probably finish this ticket.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:04.840
And they said this in their weekly meeting and they thought, oh, God, I have to finish it by the next weekly because I said I would or something like that.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.760
That's not what we expect.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.900
And that's completely fine.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:13.240
So, yeah, maybe it's a roughly four hours a week for Djanganots.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.600
Tasha would be a better person to ask that.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.480
Yeah.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:16.680
Yeah.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.660
You've recently been there.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.220
How was it?

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.920
When I started Django, when I started with the program, I was quite pumped.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:29.400
I went through all the trash tickets on the track and made an ocean dock of tickets that I wanted to take a look at and try.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.000
But I soon got burned out.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.640
Then I think I had a session with Lily.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.300
I told her that I think I'm getting a bit burned out.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.140
So she told me that you can relax a bit.

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:40.040
And she told her way of contributing to Django as well.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.920
So she told me that she has some burst of sprints where she contributes.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.920
So it's like two PRs in a month and then another month, there's no PR.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.380
So it kind of works like that.

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:57.480
But yeah, I think there's no pressure as such for Django rods to work, that they have to make a PR, that they have to make contributions regularly.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.940
So they're part of the program.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.440
Everyone can work at their own pace.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:10.200
And you can also keep communicating with your navigators and your captains to let them know what's working for you, what's not working for you.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.400
And I think it's a pretty chill environment out there.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.820
So you can just figure out what works for you.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:18.000
So for me, I think burst of sprints work for me.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.260
So if I take a ticket, I make sure that I get something going on.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:31.140
And then I take some break and then I come back to Django and I keep context switching between different open source projects.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:34.100
So that was how I got myself through the program.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:34.440
Excellent.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:34.840
Yeah.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.080
If you context switch too frequently, you kind of just never really get going.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.360
You got to save a little focus and a little deep work on one thing.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.720
Sarah, Tashar mentioned choosing tickets to contribute to.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:55.600
One of the things that's challenging about projects like Django or any other project that's been around that long with that many people using it is it's really complicated.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:02.780
And any part that you change can have really wide ranging consequences, right?

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:06.820
You don't want to take down Instagram just for a contribution.

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:13.000
So what I'm getting at is it can be hard as a beginner to find the right issues to work on.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.060
How do you navigate that?

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.860
It is definitely a challenge.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:25.660
And it's also a challenge to answer the question because it's really dependent on the individual and what are your goals.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:35.520
So if you want to achieve the, I got a PR merged into Django badge, for example, that's one potential goal.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:41.740
Or perhaps you're going, no, I want to be able to have my name again.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:51.580
Like when I see when Django 5.1 goes out and at the top, there's like the major features and like I want to have been a part of that or something like that.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.400
Then it's kind of like a different dynamic to it.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:31:04.800
And so if you are one of the individuals where you don't really mind, you just want to contribute where you can and maybe start small, for example, just to get something in.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:09.180
Then there are different strategies to go about that.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:16.180
But the best strategy, in my opinion, is it's really common in, I would say, open source in general.

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:25.340
That people come along and they submit a PR that they've done a good piece of work and it gets a PR review.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.460
And maybe there were a couple of things that needed changing.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:32.260
And then this person, for whatever reason, they vanish.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:37.660
And probably because of life or whatever it is.

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:41.260
Or they just had enough energy to do that.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.480
And that's completely fine.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:46.360
And they didn't care about it enough to do extra bits or whatever.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.480
It could be they were trying to make Django do something and they decided, you know what, I'm going to choose some other framework.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.400
Or even some other language.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.280
And they just left.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:58.300
And they're not going to come back and polish because you asked for reviews for better documentation.

00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.100
They're like, yeah, no.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:31:59.540
Exactly.

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:02.840
And for example, and you've hit the nail on the head with that.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:07.180
Because for Django to accept anything, it needs tests.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.260
It needs docs.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:12.760
And so the code itself could be completely valid already.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:17.560
It could be like the perfect solution for the issue you're trying to solve.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:22.000
But if it was missing the tests and the docs, it wouldn't be accepted.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:30.580
And so what happens is, usually what happens is after a certain period of time, the fellows might do a ping to say,

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.480
ah, do you still want to work on this or something?

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:37.940
And then after another period of time, they close it because it's gone quiet, basically.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:47.520
And so there are a bunch of these kind of unfinished starting points that you can swoop in, take that,

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.520
and you've already got like some code.

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:56.160
And it gives you good context with like, because sometimes people will share a ticket and they go,

00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:02.460
I don't even know what file I should be in to start to do this work.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:08.900
Whereas if you took a PR that's got some code, you know what file, what function, you know what's going on there.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.540
And you've got a lot more immediate stuff.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.140
Yeah, yeah.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.580
You're like, this basically works.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:17.220
It needs some polish, maybe a little optimization and the supporting stuff.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.500
Like that's a way smaller project.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:23.000
Then imagine something you could add out of thin air, right?

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:23.420
Exactly.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.220
A hundred percent.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:29.960
And then you can take those and you can be that person that pushes it over the line.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.900
And you obviously you credit the original author.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.520
You can put them in as a co-author of the commit and thank them.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:44.680
But it's a really good place to build from there because then you can slowly get more context about

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.440
what does the process of doing a PR to Django even look like?

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:53.640
Because you're going to go through the PR review and you will learn as you do it.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.460
You'll learn how the documentation works.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:00.880
You will learn how the tests work and all that kind of stuff.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:06.100
There's quite a, the contributing docs are quite extensive and scary.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.660
And it takes a while to absorb all that information.

00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:15.720
And for me personally, I have to do it to like really learn it.

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:21.440
So I would say that's how I would suggest people get started if that was your goal.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:29.620
But, and this is how I got started, but I would say it makes you like you're so scattered.

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:38.080
If I was trying to gain a really good, solid understanding of Django, I have a really weird

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:44.020
picture that's being built that I'm only getting like one pixel at a time in very random spots.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:44.300
Yeah.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.780
Maybe really deep down in the code base, you know, like pretty disconnected.

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.140
Yeah.

00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:54.040
I suddenly understand that one thing over there that's really random, but then this other

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.020
completely unrelated thing over here.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:03.420
And so I'm not gaining like a depth of a technical understanding of one section as a whole.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:09.000
So if you were someone who wanted to have that star feature that you wanted to have your name

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.420
against, then really you should go and pick a section of Django.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:20.540
So if you went into the ticket tracker called track, you can filter by components.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.360
So an area of Django.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.360
ORM or admin or something like that, right?

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.360
Exactly like this.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.260
Exactly like that.

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:34.860
And then look at just the tickets for them and they will be your practical way to get that

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:35.800
kind of information.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:41.100
But there's also sometimes there used to be a conference called Django under the hood.

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:48.620
And you might find that there was a talk about forms or something like this that's maybe relevant.

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:55.240
And you should build up your knowledge in like a much longer term perspective that you're focusing

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.740
on this area.

00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:01.160
And there might even be like other packages that are related.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:08.720
So perhaps, for example, David Smith is also a major contributor to Django and he is coming

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.540
from like a forms perspective.

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:17.520
And he is also a maintainer of Django Crispy Forms, which gives him a lot of extra context

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.480
with how people use forms in Django.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:28.380
And so he can look at tickets and use that extra way in that knowledge and his opinions

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.280
whenever people are discussing things.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:36.520
So that's a bit more of like an in-depth deep dive approach, but it might not be the quickest

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.360
way for you to get your first.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.920
Yeah, you want to get that first early win or whatever.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.660
I really like the idea of reviving a stale PR.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:45.600
That's pretty clever.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:51.940
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Posit, the makers of Shiny, formerly

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:55.300
RStudio and especially Shiny for Python.

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.220
Let me ask you a question.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.920
Are you building awesome things?

00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.980
Of course you are.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.540
You're a developer or a data scientist.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:02.460
That's what we do.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.500
And you should check out Posit Connect.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:10.000

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.480
you're building using Python.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.660
People ask me the same question all the time.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:17.820
Michael, I have some cool data science project or notebook that I built.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.120
How do I share it with my users, stakeholders, teammates?

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:25.920
Do I need to learn FastAPI or Flask or maybe Vue or React.js?

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.140
Hold on now.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:31.320
Those are cool technologies, and I'm sure you'd benefit from them, but maybe stay focused on

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:31.920
the data project?

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.400
Let Posit Connect handle that side of things?

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:39.140
With Posit Connect, you can rapidly and securely deploy the things you build in Python.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:45.580

That's talkpython.fm/P-O-S-I-T.

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.760
The link is in your podcast player show notes.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:13.000
Thank you to the team at Posit for supporting Talk Python.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.620
Tim, chilling out, the audience has a quick question for you, Tishar.

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.540
Did you ever run into a wall in the Django codebase?

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:21.780
How did you handle that?

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.180
It's very large, very old.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.740
So I imagine parts are hard.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.600
I know I get stumped when I try old tickets.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:31.380
I think one of the tickets, one of the issues that are currently out there was an accessibility

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:31.820
ticket.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.760
So basically, we want to increase the accessibility of the Django admin.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:40.300
This is something that I also found it quite interesting because it was a very interesting

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:46.040
problem to build a CI, CD pipeline that will take care of accessibility.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.200
Whether the Django admin is still or not.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:48.600
What about accessibility?

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.220
Are you talking multilingual?

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.820
Are you talking screen reader?

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.120
What are you talking?

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.880
Django serves a very large, diverse audience.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.700
And there could be people who are disabled.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.040
There could be people who are colorblind.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:06.280
So you have to take care of putting out a software that also caters to the needs of those people

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:06.700
as well.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.000
So accessibility is, yeah.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.080
So basically, there's a lot of thing in that.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.680
There's a specification that's out there to define what is a good accessible software.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:24.260
And you can have a CI, CD that checks your project with that software, with that specifications.

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.160
So I think that was a very open-ended ticket.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.380
And I faced a very big wall on how to approach that.

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.400
What all is needed there?

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.180
And the thing that I did was I reached out to my navigator and captains when I was in the

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:37.520
program.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.220
And they actually got me connected to the right people and the right person to ping.

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.880
So the track, they assigned the right people in the track that should have been in the

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.220
ticket.

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:50.260
And I think someone from the Django accessibility team came in.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:55.400
They gave me weekly updates on what's the current status of this ticket.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.360
What are we planning?

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.680
They told me that this is going to be a low-chain ticket.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:02.940
It will spread out over a month because we are planning on how to do this correctly.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:06.360
And I think, yeah, that's how I was able to get past that.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.420
The ticket is still open.

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:13.060
There's another package that has been abandoned, but we are trying to bring it in the Django

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:13.880
ecosystem, I think.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.720
So I think Mark is working on that.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:22.940
That's how I basically get past the paywall, like the ball of getting the contribution.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:29.500
And I think most of the time, navigators were very helpful because they have a lot of contribution.

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.580
And they also helped me in pointing to the right location.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:34.660
Where should I look to?

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:39.480
So I think one of the times I think I reached out to Sarah to just know why this specific

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.300
ticket was closed.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:44.220
And I was not able to find what went wrong so that this PR was reverted.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:49.040
And she pointed out to the right, like the backtracking PR that you should take a look

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:49.200
at.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:53.160
So this is how I generally just reach out because that's what the program is for.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:56.920
It highlights a super big advantage or benefit of it, right?

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:57.140
Yeah.

00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:03.220
A normal contributor can't just make all these connections or even necessarily know who was

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.480
involved in the original effort.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.640
Why was it shut down?

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.160
Is it something the project doesn't want?

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.480
Or did people abandon it?

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:12.800
Or none of that is accessible from the, or less accessible from the outside.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.920
Yes, I completely agree.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.560
So people have been listening.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:18.260
Maybe they're pretty excited to be part of it.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.920
Do you have another cohort coming along?

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:21.920
When's the next one?

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:25.940
Okay, so we are just starting the first of the year.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.700
That starts on the 15th of January.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:31.620
So if you wanted, if this is the first time you've heard about it, unfortunately, you're

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.860
not in the, it's too late for that one, unfortunately.

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.940
And that one's pretty much left the station.

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:42.280
Well, I have a benefit for you with a little bit of podcasting time travel.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.180
So this probably won't come out for six weeks.

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:44.540
Oh.

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:49.400
So on the main audio, although it's already on YouTube for folks listening there.

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:53.940
So it'll be a little closer to the start of the one after that, if there's going to be

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:54.300
a third.

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:54.580
Okay.

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:55.220
Interesting.

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.000
Thank you for that tip.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:04.020
The best place to check at any point, if you wanted to check if there is, if we're accepting

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:11.340
applications for a session is you could go to the Janganaut Space website and then click

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:12.700
on sessions.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:17.560
And when you click on sessions, you will see exactly right now.

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:23.300
You can see that the session that we have is if you scroll a bit further down on the screen,

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:30.440
we're sharing this session and you can see the latest information of the applications, when

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.880
it starts and all the details about that particular session.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:41.640
And so whenever we agree to do a new session, that will appear on our website and there will

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:46.320
be this apply button essentially when applications are open.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:52.940
So in six weeks time, that might be the case that we are accepting new applications.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:58.340
There is also a interest form that we have.

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:06.220
So again, on there's, yes, if you click back on sessions at the top, there is a join us secret

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:06.900
button.

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.020
Yeah, exactly.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.580
Top tip.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:14.560
And here you can send us your email.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:20.320
And what this just means is we will send you an email as soon as applications open for the

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:20.860
next session.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.240
And then you will be the first to know.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.740
The other thing is, is we're on social media.

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:29.600
We're on X and Mastodon and LinkedIn.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.620
So followers on all of those places.

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:38.120
And we, you will, we will also post there for everything when, when that's.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.080
Yeah, definitely.

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:44.220
And I'll put those in the podcast show notes so people can click on them and find all these

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:44.520
things.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.960
It also seems you all are on YouTube.

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.360
What happens over on YouTube?

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.520
We are on YouTube.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:54.500
And amazingly, we have, we gained some followers before we've even really done anything, but

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:55.500
this is our plan.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:07.520
So also in session, we have a couple of guest speakers who come and the Django Nauts can,

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:14.680
they will usually talk about some topic and they've got some particular experiences that

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.960
they can share and that you have a little bit of a Q&A with them.

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:26.700
So in the pilot session, both Marish and Natalia, who are the two Django fellows, they had a session

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:30.620
with our Django Nauts and we record these sessions.

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:36.760
And what we want to do is we want to publish these on our YouTube to make that available

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:42.500
to everybody because there's quite interesting information that gets shared in these talks.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:47.160
And the whole aim of open source is to, to share information really.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:54.260
So that is the main plan for the YouTube channel, but we're not there yet, but maybe by the time

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.080
the podcast is published, there will be later videos.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:58.080
You've got a few weeks to work on it.

00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.040
That's cool.

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.500
So people can smash the subscribe and crush the bell over there.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:03.420
That'll be cool.

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.100
So how many people are in the next cohort?

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:08.840
The 2024 first cohort?

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.380
There is 18 Django Nauts.

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:14.260
So we've really scaled it up since the pilot.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:15.120
Yeah.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.260
So that's six teams.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:19.420
Whereas last time we had two teams.

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:20.700
So quite a few more.

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.260
Yeah, that's cool.

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.200
What's the cross team story, right?

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:28.720
Like I can imagine, say like some kind of startup accelerator where there's groups and, but sometimes

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:32.180
they get together and present to each other what they're building, what they're doing.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:36.480
Like, is there something like that where the teams cross pollinate or whatever?

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:37.100
Yeah.

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:41.760
We have, you're in the same discord and we have channels that are available to everybody

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:48.200
and we are trying to achieve a community feel and that you can work with other people.

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:54.580
So we do have a, a life channel where people share things about, I don't know that they went

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:55.160
on a run.

00:45:55.160 --> 00:46:00.700
It's a little bit more around the, the humanizing individual and all this kind of stuff.

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:08.240
But there are channels which are about works work, I say, but, you know, contributing specifically.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:15.060
So on tickets and people can share the work that they're doing and say, Hey, I want some

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:15.820
input on this.

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:18.100
Or does anybody want to work together with me on that?

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:24.560
And there's nothing stopping a Django not from working with another Django not who's in a

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.320
different team.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:32.920
The team is just a structure to give you a group that is manageable for, for one human to

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:33.620
look after.

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:38.240
And for you to have a meaningful discussion in a, in a smaller group.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:38.880
We get too big.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.680
It just becomes a bunch of anonymous people that happen to be in the same program.

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:43.060
Yeah.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.180
William out there has an interesting question.

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:49.940
As you talk about adding more than before, what are your plans on scaling this?

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.840
And what do you feel are limiting factors?

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:54.100
That's a really awesome question, William.

00:46:54.100 --> 00:47:04.020
So limiting factors are usually getting mentors who agree to do it at the same time.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:09.960
And it's interesting as to whether we continue to organize it, that it's a session that everyone

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:18.520
is there at the same time, or whether we allow it to no longer be a single cohort and that somebody

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:24.120
could be like, right, there's two people who are available from this state to this state, and

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.920
therefore they can look after a few Django nots, for example.

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:34.400
That could be an option for us to prevent this larger cohort, because it means that we're trying to get

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:40.060
a group of, I don't know, eight volunteers who can all do this time period at the same time.

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.700
That's a challenge.

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:48.460
And we did struggle to, we got a reasonable amount of people.

00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:53.820
We'll raise their hands to be mentors, but we could always do with more of them.

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:58.760
So if anyone wants to do that, that's, we would love to hear from you.

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:02.740
So that's another thing that kind of limits that scale.

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:07.620
And the other thing is, is we are learning the challenges as we go.

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:11.960
So fortunately, we haven't had any issues yet.

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:18.040
We have, for example, a code of conduct, and there is a way that people could report something

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.840
that we should be aware of.

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.820
And we haven't had that report yet.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.140
Touch wood, it will never happen.

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:32.020
But there's some things that we, it will take a few iterations for us to really test, stress

00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:37.160
test our processes and check that this is going to be capable of scale.

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.500
But yeah, who knows?

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:39.280
We're not there yet.

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.400
Well, you know what?

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:47.220
One positive feedback loop is people like Tushar who went through it, but now are supporting its

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:47.840
growth, right?

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:48.840
Yeah, definitely.

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:49.240
Yeah.

00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:52.580
And a question for you from Sarah Shars.

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:56.980
I saw multiple, or at least one person out in the audience saying, hey, I'm going to be

00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:57.700
in the next cohort.

00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:03.360
So do you have any advice as a former Django not for new ones who are about to get started?

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:07.920
Yeah, I think one of the important advices would be to have a lot of fun.

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:12.400
You can contribute to Django, but also you make a lot of good connections.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:19.020
So also like be around in the Django discord, Django, Django not discord, interact with people,

00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:24.100
talk with each other, attend the sessions, just get to know them a lot.

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:30.300
Because that three weeks, the amount of time that you'll be part of the Django not program

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:36.560
will be, they'll focus on getting you left off, but you should plan on making this program

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:37.160
whole sustainable.

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:42.120
So just try to be around, keep talking with different people and have fun.

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:42.640
Good advice.

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:47.440
All right, let's round this out with what are the benefits for the people who are participating?

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.180
And I suppose also navigators and captains.

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:57.020
One thing I see here that would be really a bonus is just the edge it gives you in working

00:49:57.020 --> 00:50:02.420
in web development and Python as a job opportunity going forward, right?

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:08.320
If you say, yes, I know how to do a database query with the Django ORM, please hire me.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.080
That's one thing.

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:12.780
It's another to say, I added that feature that you're excited about.

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:15.200
Can we talk about my position, right?

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:18.100
Okay, everyone else is off the table, as long as you're a decent fit, right?

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:22.400
Like that all of a sudden just puts you in a different stratosphere, I guess, sticking

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:22.900
with a theme.

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:29.020
So maybe you all could speak a little bit to advantages beyond just, I want to contribute

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:31.580
to open source and have the badge or whatever it is.

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:32.220
Yeah, absolutely.

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:38.420
I think my first job was basically like no interviews just based on my open source profile.

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:44.580
The company or the current company that I'm part of also have some open source products.

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:45.940
So I was just involved with that.

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:51.480
And the job was just a simple, like one-on-one kinds of conversations on what other projects

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.920
are, different open source contributions.

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.080
You're like, hey, it's a chart.

00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.260
It seems like you're doing this for free.

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.740
How about we pay you to do this?

00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:59.040
Okay.

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.100
You convinced me.

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:00.460
Yeah.

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:03.380
So yeah, that's what actually happened.

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:09.220
I think you get a lot of, I mean, contributing to open source, you get a lot of visibility.

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.440
There are a lot of people that reach out to you.

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:18.200
And I think the best part of it is, as I said it before, you just grow compoundly.

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.080
There's no stopping when you get started with this stuff.

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.600
Initially, there's a barrier that you have to push before you get started.

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:29.760
But I think Jaguarot will do that work for you to help you push that initial barrier, get

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:30.540
the inertia moving.

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:33.960
And then it's all just a good walk down the path.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:40.860
Even beyond getting your first job or getting your foot in the door, or if you're with certain

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:45.220
roles, you might come to a point where there's usually this learning curve, right?

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:50.320
Where at the start you learn loads and then it really levels off and you've become efficient

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:57.720
and you kind of know the processes and you've been asked to make yet another API endpoint for

00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:58.160
something.

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:03.860
And it's kind of fairly, you're not learning so much as you were in the early days.

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:04.380
Go with me here.

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:07.580
What we need is we're going to need a grid of things in the database.

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.040
And I need you to be able to edit in the set.

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:09.820
Okay.

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.600
Like the five other ones I just built.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:11.920
Got it.

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:12.160
Okay.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:12.880
That kind of thing.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.120
Yeah.

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:13.560
Okay.

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:20.060
I also get it that, you know, and companies don't necessarily want you to experiment too

00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:23.580
much because experiments are risky and all this kind of stuff.

00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:29.460
So depending on when you work, maybe you've got lots of opportunities to learn lots of new

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:33.820
stuff, but some people will be in a position where actually they go, oh, I've

00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:37.240
I don't feel like I've learned anything this year or something like that.

00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:44.400
And I think open source or contributed to Django particularly, like there's, it's so big

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:50.660
and there's so much there that you can really learn about if you want to.

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:56.480
And completely with no pressure at your own pace and with really friendly people.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:03.820
And so there is, you know, if you engage in that as a practice, it can also give that you

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:09.020
the joy of programming again, that you can go, you know what, this is a really tough problem

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.220
and I can really think about this.

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:15.460
And it's not like a problem that's screaming at me that needs to be like fixed straight away

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:15.920
or whatever.

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:20.440
But you know, and I think there's lots of those opportunities in there too.

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:24.160
It's always a struggle as you get to work for some company.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.460
They're like, yeah, we're not changing that.

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:25.940
That works.

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:27.040
We're not messing with that.

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.800
We're not ready for Python 2.7 yet.

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.640
We're still on 2.6.

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.960
So let's just calm down there.

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:34.500
Okay, sure.

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:37.680
I see some other people asking, is this a Discord?

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:40.440
This is a private Discord for the cohort.

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:43.120
It's not something public that others can participate in.

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:43.620
That's true.

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:48.620
There is a Django Discord that is public to everybody and I would recommend joining there.

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:49.600
So please do.

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.380
And a lot of people are in both.

00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:58.640
And if you dropped into the Contributing Getting Started channel or the Contributor Discussions

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:04.040
channel and you were to talk about a ticket, it's very likely that I and other Django contributors

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.980
are going to engage with you directly.

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:07.280
So there's that.

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:12.620
That the Django Not Space Discord is designed for the cohort to give people a little bit

00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:20.860
of a smaller community feel and allow them to feel comfortable sharing the pictures of their

00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:24.180
dogs and things like that when they're very new to this.

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.280
So yeah, that's how it's working.

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:26.660
Excellent.

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:27.620
All right.

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:31.780
Let's wrap this up really quick with just one broader thing.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.920
Maybe there's many other communities out there listening.

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:38.420
I wish we had a not, some kind of astronaut type thing for us.

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:43.240
What advice would you give to other open source communities that maybe want to have this type

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:43.580
of thing?

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:44.680
Give it a go.

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:45.600
I really try it out.

00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:51.780
I think we're very happy for people to take, I mean, all of our documentations are on a GitHub.

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:52.560
It's all open source.

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.880
Please take it and make it your own.

00:54:54.880 --> 00:55:01.960
You can use different names and keep in touch with us and tell us what works for you and

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.020
what you've changed and what's better.

00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:12.200
And yeah, for us, we wanted to start off with something quite lightweight and basic.

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:20.080
And when we started, for example, we, okay, we had a name, but no one knew who we were because

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.360
we just invented it.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:25.240
And for example, with Tushar, we reached out to some individuals.

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:29.740
So in the past, when we'd seen some people be interested, we, those were the first people

00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:30.440
we contacted.

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:32.720
So you can start really small, really basic.

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:37.220
You don't have to have a launch where you're accepting applications because when you have

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:40.700
applications, you need to figure out what does an application even look like and then

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:41.580
how are you going to review it?

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:42.060
What are the criteria?

00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:43.200
Yeah, all that.

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:43.840
100%.

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:50.340
So start small and then you can build it out in a way that works for you and see how it

00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:50.580
goes.

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:51.040
All right.

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.000
Well, excellent.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.760
I think that's probably it for all the time we have today, but I want to congratulate you

00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:00.020
both on this really cool community you built and are building.

00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:01.240
Final call to action.

00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:02.840
People are excited about Django Knots.

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:03.340
What do you tell them?

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:10.380
Oh, just follow us on our social media and please do apply when we have sessions.

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:16.360
We really, really appreciate all the applications that we receive and mentors are always wanted

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:16.880
and needed.

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:18.760
So get in touch.

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:19.340
Yeah, please.

00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:20.040
Yeah, of course.

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:20.200
Yeah.

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:20.580
Yeah.

00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:25.760
Go to the session section and click join us and fill out the form if you think you might in

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.600
the future want to be part of it, right?

00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:28.140
Indeed.

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:29.020
All right.

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:34.080
Sarah, thank you for being on the show and thanks for sharing your project.

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:34.900
It's very great.

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:35.540
Thanks, Michael.

00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:39.380
This has been another episode of Talk Python to me.

00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:41.200
Thank you to our sponsors.

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.800

It really helps support the show.

00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:51.500
It's time to stop asking relational databases to do more than they were made for and simplify

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.780
complex data models with graphs.

00:56:53.780 --> 00:57:00.200
Check out the sample FastAPI project and see what Neo4j, a native graph database, can do

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:00.600
for you.

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:05.040
