00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
Are you interested in contributing to Django? There is an amazing mentorship program that

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.020
helps Python and Django enthusiasts become contributors and potentially core developers

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.460
of Django. It's called Djangonauts and their slogan is where contributors launch. On this

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.140
episode, we have Sarah Boyce from the Django team and former Django knot and now Django

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.700
knot mentor to Shara Gupta. Not only is this project excellent for the Django community,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.700
many open source communities would do well to keep an eye on how this creative project

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:51.740
is going. This is talk Python to me episode 451 recorded January 10 2024.

Hello, hello. Hey, Sarah. Hey, Tushar. Welcome to talk Python to me. So good to have you

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.100
both on the show. You know, when I saw the Djangonauts project, I think it was Brian

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.100
Okken that had found it and started talking about on Python bytes initially. I'm like,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.380
oh, that is a brilliant idea. I definitely, definitely need to talk to the people behind

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.540
it. So, so glad to have you both here. You both are playing multiple roles in this whole

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.860
process, which is fantastic. So excited to dive into the Djangonauts.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.780
Amazing. I actually remember when that came up and we were all got excited and we're like,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.460
how on earth did they find it?

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.580
That entire show is just about finding stuff that's interesting like that, that maybe doesn't

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.820
get a light shown on it and shining that light. So awesome. Glad, happy we're able to do it.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.620
And we'll do it a little bit more today. We'll, we'll make it the whole topic. How's that?

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.620
Awesome. Yeah, indeed. Now, before we dive into all that, let's just start with your

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.300
story and what, how do you do the programming? What do you do these days, Sarah? Let's start

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.300
with you.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.420
Okay. Yeah. So I am a Django developer. That's probably not surprising. I've been doing that

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:29.940
pretty much my entire developer career. It's about five years and about a year, two years

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:37.820
ago, I started getting involved in open source contributions to Django core. And now I'm

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.540
part of the review and triage team, which is a fancy name for saying like active core

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.780
Django contributor group or something like that. And yeah, why I'm here today is now

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.580
we've got the mentorship program that I co-organize.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.300
Yeah. It's amazing. What kind of apps do you work on? Have you worked on in Django? Like,

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.540
how are you building APIs or what are you building?

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.780
Yeah. Good question. So originally I was pretty much full stack Django experience with Django

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:14.860
templates and then I changed companies and then it was with a react front end and a Django

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.980
rest framework API backend, which is perhaps quite a typical setup really. And I've changed

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:31.780
again and now I'm a developer advocate for JetBrains. So I no longer have to maintain

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.860
a web application. So yeah, that's me.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.940
Yeah. The dev relationship can't go down at night, right? You're not going to get woken

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.900
up on a weekend because somebody upgraded the database and now your app doesn't work

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.220
anymore. Now I'm a huge fan of JetBrains and what they're doing. That must be a fun place

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.220
to work I imagine. Yeah, indeed.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.460
Tushar, how about you?

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.660
Hi everyone. So I'm Tushar Gupta. I'm from India and I have recently graduated. I graduated

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.900
in 2023. So that was my first undergrad course. And I currently work as a software engineer

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.140
at Samagra Governance and where we deal with problems related to Indian governments. So

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.620
we work alongside with the Indian government and create solutions that helps them govern

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:21.100
better. That's my day job. And I've been involved with open source from my sophomore year. That

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.780
was the place like I was quite shocked seeing, wow, there are people who are there to help

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.100
you for free and you get so high quality code reviews just for free. So like, yeah, it was

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.100
a full package for me. And I got into some fellowships and one of the fellowships, I'm

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.780
not sure if you've heard of it, was Major League Hacking. They ran a fellowship and

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.340
in there I got introduced to Django and to Carlton as well. And I think from there only

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.980
Django Nodes got me as one of the contributors trying to get into the code and they reached

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.340
out for the pilot program. So yeah, that's me. And now I'm here.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.740
Oh, wonderful. So you said you just recently started working as a software developer professionally.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.260
Is that right? Yeah. How are you liking it?

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.380
I think it's pretty good. I've been always amazed with how much I can do with my laptop.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.740
And now that you have a job, which also kind of create, lets you create some real impact.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:21.580
I can literally see students in public schools using our apps, using our APIs to get better

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.860
at their normal courses. So yeah, it's been a complete amazing experience.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.740
It's definitely fun. I think the hardest part about software development is getting your

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.180
first job. And once you have a little bit of credibility and experience, then it's,

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.820
you know, then it's kind of chasing what you're interested in. But yeah, congratulations.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:43.660
That's excellent. Let's dive in. Let's blast off. Huh? Let's blast off with the Django

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:51.640
Nodes, right? And you really have leaned into this space and astronaut angle here. The website

00:06:51.640 --> 00:07:00.580
is django-node.space. We have navigators and captains and Django Nodes and so on. So yeah,

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.820
very fun, very playful, I think. And that's on one hand, it's like, whatever, what difference

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.060
does it make? On the other, I think it makes a difference, right? Especially for people

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.940
who are getting more into programming, like it should sound fun because it is fun. But

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.940
you know, I think it just, it draws people in. It certainly did me when I heard about

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:23.740
it, like I said. Awesome. Yeah. So Sarah, let's, I'll let you introduce this whole program.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:29.940
It's pretty neat. Tell us about it. There's been a need for more mentorship within the

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:38.260
Django kind of open source community for some time. And we have already participated in

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:44.420
some other programs like the Major League Hacking and Google Summer of Code. But sometimes

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:51.860
we don't always retain people. We have variable success. And there are still a bunch of people

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.580
who appear in our like help channels. And they're always like, oh, I'm interested in

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:01.780
mentorship. Please help me. How do I get started, etc. And it felt like there could be more

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:06.660
that we could be doing there. This topic of we need a mentorship program, we need a mentorship

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:14.540
program came up a number of times. And eventually, we launched Django.space as our answer to

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:22.380
that kind of need. We took heavy inspiration from the Kubernetes ladder program. So the

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:29.460
Kubernetes community or it also has their own contributor mentorship program. And that

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:35.600
had like the concept of cohorts, for example, which we've very much borrowed and things

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.440
like this. So what we wanted to do was to design something that could be quite lightweight

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:47.700
and sustainable, as we want to respect everybody's time that's involved and kind of appreciate

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:54.060
that the open source experience is a little bit in and out. And you will. And that's kind

00:08:54.060 --> 00:09:01.940
of normal also. So anyway, what we're kind of iterating on is we now have a eight week

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:08.500
program, which actually the next program starts on Monday. So we're just about getting everybody

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:16.060
excited and together for that right now. And in the program, we have Djangonauts. This

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:23.420
is our term for mentees, like the participants of the program, and they will be assigned

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:31.060
a navigator in like a team. So there's about a team of three mentees or Djangonauts with

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:38.700
one navigator. The navigator is a person who has open source contributor experience and

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:45.100
some kind of background that they can use to like answer questions and all this kind

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:51.580
of stuff. Do they have to be a Django core developer or do you have to be even a contributor

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:56.160
to Django or do they, you know, if I was saying I worked on flask and I was really awesome

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.380
at it, but, but I also want to help these folks over here. I'm really good at open source,

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:08.180
but not so much Django contributor yet. So we have expanded the program. So in the pilot,

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:14.380
it was originally just Django core that we were focusing on. And now we have a navigators

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:20.880
that have a focus on other packages. So for example, Tim Schilling is one of the maintainers

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:28.760
of Django debug toolbar. And Mark Walker is, I think he's the tech lead of Django CMS.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:37.300
And so we are kind of incorporating that we want to build a contributor base to the Django

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:44.180
ecosystem as a whole, because all of the packages really do help him and support Django. It's

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:49.780
part of the real core value of Django as a framework is, is the other open source packages

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:56.340
that are around it. And who knows whether we will expand even further later on. But

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:02.980
I think really the thing that's, that's key is having a little bit of open source experience.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:09.380
And to be honest, a lot of it is transferable. So a little bit around etiquette for reviews,

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:17.260
like don't @ people all the time and all this kind of stuff. Things like that. We then have

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:24.100
one other role, which is the, the captain and they add another layer of support to the

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:31.740
program. So these are kind of like a supportive pastoral role and they have more one-to-one

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:37.940
sessions with the Django notes to get to know them, check that they're okay. And if there

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.820
was anything that kind of they wanted to talk about, but they didn't feel comfortable mentioning

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:50.740
it in a larger group. So we do have a discord chat and we also have these weekly check-ins

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:55.140
that they have with the navigators and the team, but the captains one-to-one, if you've

00:11:55.140 --> 00:12:00.700
got something that you, perhaps you've been really poorly and you want to talk about that

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:06.260
and anything that comes up in life that perhaps you didn't feel comfortable announcing to

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.260
the world.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.260
Yeah, sure.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:14.060
Can come up in with your captain. So they're really there to also normalize any of the

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.780
anxieties or feelings that you have around working in public, because if this is the

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:24.620
first time you're doing that, it's, it's also a little bit vulnerable. So yeah. Also shout

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.620
out to the captains.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.260
Yeah. Awesome. I think that's a pretty powerful way to organize this, right? You've got a

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:34.860
lot of support. The thing that strikes me about this is it feels a little bit like a

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:40.020
bootcamp, right? Like a coding bootcamp. I'm, I'm going to just take the next three months

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:45.620
off and dive into this, but way more lightweight than that. And also I think for other people

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.260
who might be thinking that it's worth pointing out that the goal is not to teach people how

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.260
to Django, right?

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.260
Yes. A hundred percent.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.820
Yeah. Tushar, you want to add to that as well? You're shaking your head there.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.820
Yeah. So Django.NET is not a bootcamp. I think we have, we have been getting a lot of questions

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:04.220
around that as well, that whether it's a bootcamp, whether someone will be taught how to Django,

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:08.580
but it's not like that. It's a, you can think of it as a program which gives you the right

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.940
support, right people and right resources in case if you want to contribute to the core

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:19.100
Django or the Django ecosystem. So it kinds of brings in all the right people together

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:24.460
for a short time so that you can get the needed lift off that you want and get started with

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.460
the Django.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:30.460
I guess the mental model people should have is primarily the goal here is to increase

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:35.860
the contributors to maybe Django. Maybe as you mentioned, Sarah, a little bit broader,

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:40.820
like maybe you could contribute to Tim's project, the Django debug toolbar, just don't leave

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:46.740
it on in production. And, and those types of things, right? Like in the broader ecosystem,

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:53.140
bringing people in to contribute to Django more broadly. So it's specifically about treating

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:58.620
people who make those contributions rather than saying, I heard that programming is cool,

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.940
so I'm going to quit my marketing job and do that.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:07.060
Exactly. And a thing that, cause what is success? It's such an interesting question because

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:14.500
we get random commits from people all the time. And really what it's not necessarily

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:20.420
that there aren't going to be contributors to Django. Django is quite a big package.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:26.260
People will always come and suggest things and, and give some, some code. It's more also

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:33.060
around that Django has a community behind it. And the people who stick around longer

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:38.460
term, they feel like they're part of that community and that they're part of something

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:45.860
a little bit bigger than just a commit in this cold, heartless code base that's somewhere.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:53.620
And so if we can get people to feel like actually there are a bunch of real, very helpful people

00:14:53.620 --> 00:15:00.380
who are working on Django and other packages around it, and that you could interact with

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:07.380
these people. And a lot of them are now my friends. It kind of is trying to show that

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:12.380
there's a lot more to it and there's this value you can keep getting. And hopefully

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:17.900
then people will stick around. And I think it's more the, if you can stick around and

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:23.460
do sustainable contributions over a longer period of time, that builds up to something

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:28.380
really quite huge. And I think for me that, that I find that really exciting.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:36.100
Yeah. To me, Django more than almost any other sub community of a programming world, not

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:41.700
Python itself, but you know, versus, you know, Flask, Lightstar, whatever other web frameworks,

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:48.860
ORMs, whatever it, it seems really to build a community around it and not just technical

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:53.820
excellence, right? Like Django has a lot of technical attributes that people are attracted

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:58.180
to. I would, a lot of the Django people I talked to are attracted because of the community

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:02.620
and the support and, and they just want to be part of that thing. That's amazing.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:08.300
Yeah. I think you can see that in the Django Nod program itself. When I first got in, I

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:13.500
thought like meeting all the core contributors face to face, having chats with them and seeing

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:18.500
problems that they face, managing open source and then the, then their actual job and then

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.420
the Django contributions. And now there's a program. So I can see how much they're putting

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:26.300
into what's maintaining and building this community and how much they care about it.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:33.060
So it gives you a good inclusive feeling as well. And I found it really good.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:39.300
Yeah. This portion of talk Python to me is brought to you by Neo4j. Do you know Neo4j?

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:45.060
Neo4j is a native graph database. And if the slowest part of your data access patterns

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:50.300
involves computing relationships, why not use a database that stores those relationships

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:55.440
directly in the database? Unlike your typical relational one, a graph database lets you

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.100
model the data, the way it looks in the real world, instead of forcing it into rows and

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:05.300
columns, it's time to stop asking a relational database to do more than they were made for

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:11.100
and simplify complex data models with graphs. If you haven't used a graph database before,

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:16.340
you might be wondering about common use cases. What's it for? Here are just a few detecting

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:23.600
fraud, enhancing AI, managing supply chains, gaining a 360 degree view of your data and

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:30.420
anywhere else you have highly connected data to use Neo4j from Python. It's a simple pip

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:36.000
install Neo4j. And to help you get started, their docs include a sample web app demonstrating

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.340
how to use it both from Flask and FastAPI. Find it in their docs or search GitHub for

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:47.400
Neo4j movies application quick start. Developers are solving some of the world's biggest problems

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:58.960
with graphs. Now it's your turn. Visit talkpython.fm/neo4j to get started. That's talkpython.fm/neo4j.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:04.760
Thank you to Neo4j for supporting Talk Python To Me. I'm sorry if I'm leaving some community

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:09.500
out that I just don't know, but the only other part of Python that I feel really has it as

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:15.840
nailed as that is the SciPy space. It seems like the Jupiter and the scientific computing

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.920
side, there's kind of a big community there. You've got NumFocus that actually funds a

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:27.120
lot of that specifically in that area, but it's pretty unique. Speaking about funding,

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.680
I don't see a pricing on your page here. What's the price?

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:40.760
Oh, I wasn't prepared enough for this question. Okay. Right. So, okay. If we compared ourselves

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:49.360
to Outreachy or Google Summer of Codes, they do actually have a sponsorship where they

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.880
do pay the, it's almost like a scholarship that you're going to work on.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.120
Right. Like an internship almost type thing. Yeah.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.120
Exactly.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.120
A little. Yeah. Okay.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:05.920
So we have that money. We have been very generously given a grant from the Django Software Foundation

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:12.780
to help us grow this program. And we will be using that in different places in order

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:21.520
to do that. But at some point we'd like to sponsorship from companies. So if you're listening

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:26.600
and that's something that you think would be a good idea, then, you know, please get

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.840
in touch with the organizers. That would be awesome.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.480
Yeah. Sarah, you should go on a podcast and let the companies know.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.480
Yeah. That's a great idea.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.840
No. Well, I think that's awesome. And it would be really, I do want to encourage companies

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.760
out there listening to have connections back to Django or just want to get in front of

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.480
Django developers for whatever reason to do that. That would be awesome. But it doesn't

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.880
cost money to participate as a...

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.440
Oh, a hundred percent. No.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.440
Django not, right?

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:56.360
No, no, no. I mean, yeah. Back to what Tushar said at the very start that like he couldn't

00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:02.680
believe that you got these amazing quality, like PR reviews from all these experienced

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:10.080
engineers for free. I think open source is this incredible resource where you can get

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:18.080
very usable real life programming experience and yeah, generally for free. So no, we don't,

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.440
we don't charge people to be part of this.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:25.720
That's awesome. And you can participate in very professional type of projects without

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.600
having to go through and getting a job at a fame company or whatever. Right. You're

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.200
just like, I'm going to be part of this, this get out project. And it looks like they have

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.440
continuous integration and code reviews and these experts and so on. It's very cool. It's

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:45.200
pretty magical open source. Tushar, so originally you were a Django not, and now you coming

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:51.640
back to pay it forward a little bit afterwards. So let's start by talking about your experience

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.360
going through the program. Like, what were you thinking when you signed up for it? What

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.680
was it? And what was the day to day like, and then what did you get out of it?

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:04.920
I think I got pretty excited when I saw this email. So I got an email, I think a few months

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:09.720
back saying that there's a program that Django, program named Django not that is going to

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.480
be started. We have, it's a very small program. We are going to be in a teams of three to

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:18.720
four and whether are you interested or not? So it was a complete yes for me that I'm totally

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:24.120
interested and I reverted back to the email. And after a few days I got a selection email

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:29.520
that yeah, you are finally in. I also shared it with some of my juniors who are also trying

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.640
to contribute to Django rest frameworks, Django stubs and other projects to like, here's the

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:41.200
GitHub link of the program that is going in a pilot mode. Just go and try out. So I think

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:47.200
one of the other folks named Anwen, she also got in. He's also now joining us as a captain.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:52.280
And during my phase of the Django not, I think the best part, the best part of this program

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.920
that I've talked about a lot of times before as well, the core difference that I saw in

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.480
contributing to different projects and joining in as Django not was you were actually meeting

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:07.120
real people that were not just awesome GitHub usernames that you know that you just talk

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:14.440
over technically, but you can really talk with them where they live, how they look and

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:20.040
just get on with what got them started with the project and how, how they do stuff. So

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.520
that gave me a kind of inclusive inclusivity, a sense of belonging in the community that

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:28.960
I know people, I know Sarah, I know Sarah voice. I know Rachel. I know a lot of people

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:35.120
now I know Tim and it got me like it gave me some kind of motivation to just be keep

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.560
just be involved in respect of like not lose my motivation and just be with the program.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:47.120
So during the Django not phase, I contributed, I think a few PRS there's one that's on the

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.240
accessibility part of Django. I think it's in a work of progress. So it's just getting

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.440
in slowly and slowly. There's some docs changes that I've done. And then there's another one

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.800
that is just in preview. Another thing that I was getting out of Django not was I know

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:07.160
there are, there is a focused group that is communicating to me about my PRS and how I

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.920
can get better reviews. If the reviews are getting delayed, I was getting active response

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:16.000
on like the team is currently busy or maybe there's a holiday season going on. Maybe there's

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.080
a new Django major release that's going on. So team is not getting enough time to currently

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:25.880
review it. So I didn't feel isolated or hosted out there, but I knew like there are people

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:30.480
who are seeing this and the whole experience was very good meeting a lot of new people

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.600
and it was just fun. So that's how Django not worked for me.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:40.360
Yeah. Excellent. And you're going on to become a captain for the next cohort, right? So you're

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.120
doing the one-on-one mentorship side of things.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:48.720
Yeah. I wanted to, so I asked when the Django not program was about to be ended, I asked

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:55.440
Sarah, there's another Sarah. So I asked her, is there any way I can still be around? And

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.600
like, can this, can this discord group be continued or are we going to just shut it

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:05.160
now as a program? So she told me that, no, we are going to have another cohort and you

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.760
can come in as a Django not captain if you want and just meet other people. And I mean,

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:14.040
I was like, why not? Like meeting a lot of new people. And there are a lot of people

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:19.960
from that country that I'm from. So that got me even more excited that there were folks

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.400
out there that I didn't knew of and now I know them. So yeah.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:29.160
That's excellent. Probably you're more likely to go to conferences where there's Django

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.360
people meeting and just generally be more part of the community, right? Not just this.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:39.160
Yeah, I completely agree. I think just the part Django not nailed completely is doing

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:43.880
one-on-ones, video calls. It just gives you some sense of belonging. Yeah. It's great

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.480
to see people one-to-one and talk with them. So it's fun.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:55.080
Yeah. You always notice it that after a DjangoCon, so there's DjangoCon US and DjangoCon Europe

00:24:55.080 --> 00:25:00.680
happens pretty much every year. We just had a DjangoCon Africa for the first time, but

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:08.160
we don't have a DjangoCon Asia or a DjangoCon South America. And there are regions that

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:14.680
don't have this opportunity of a conference each year that the community really gets together

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:20.280
and that you meet people. And whenever you see the conference and you see people afterwards,

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:25.320
they're buzzing and everyone's so excited to have gotten together and to really reignite

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:32.400
that kind of community feeling. But it's not accessible to everybody. And it's really nice

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:39.960
for us to try and recreate a little bit. It's not the same as a DjangoCon, of course, but

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:46.320
a little bit of that Django magic. If we can bring a little bit of that experience to a

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:53.400
wider group of people, I think it's really special because I think that's really what

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.360
Django is about for me.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:00.800
Yeah. For every person that is pretty close or pretty accessible to a local meetup or

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:06.120
a regional conference, there are many, many people who work by themselves, live far from

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:12.220
those places, and these types of things serve a really important connection to the community

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:18.560
that way. All right, Sarah, what about time commitments? What's the day to day look like?

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.800
12 hours a day? What do you all do?

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:27.520
Yeah, it's constant. Right. So that's one of the things we really try to design also.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:34.800
We have, as a Django-not, it is self-managed and self-guided. So with the amount of time

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:40.800
commitment we're saying it's maybe four hours a week, but it can really vary. So if you

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:47.100
did two hours or maybe one week, you decided that you're going to spend your whole Saturday

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:55.400
or whatever, it can really be driven by that participant. We're not going to be there with

00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:02.440
a whip saying, "Please do more or do less." Actually, the do less would be a concern.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:09.800
I mean, we do want to make sure that this is sustainable. And if we saw people, I don't

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:15.120
know, constantly working on something without ever taking a break, then that would be something

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:20.880
that we would want the captains and the navigator to go in and check that they're okay and that

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.560
they know it's not the end of the world and that they can take a break.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.920
Yeah. That happens to me when I get really just super into something, usually some new

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:34.960
technology, I'll just work and work and take a break. "Wow, I'm hungry. Oh, it's because

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:40.480
I haven't eaten for eight hours. What's going on?" But to me, it's kind of cool to get lost

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.720
that way, but you shouldn't set it as an expectation, right?

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:48.680
Yes, exactly. And people work really differently. And if this is sustainable and it works for

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:54.640
you, then that's completely fine. But if it was that somebody said, "Oh, I will probably

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:59.840
finish this ticket," and they said this in their weekly meeting and they thought, "Oh

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.840
God, I have to finish it by the next weekly because I said I would," or something like

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:10.800
that, that's not what we expect and that's completely fine. So yeah, maybe it's roughly

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:16.200
four hours a week for Djangonauts. Tushar would be a better person to ask that.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.240
Yeah. You've recently been there. How was it?

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:23.120
When I started Django, when I started with the program, I was quite pumped. I went through

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:28.200
all the trash tickets on the track and made a notion doc of tickets that I wanted to take

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:32.880
a look at and try, but I soon got burned out. Then I think I had a session with Lily. I

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:37.360
told her that I think I'm getting a bit burned out. So she told me that you can relax a bit.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:42.320
And she told her way of contributing to Django as well. So she told me that she has some

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.880
burst of sprints where she contributes. So it's like two PRs in a month and then another

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.080
month there's no PR. So it kind of works like that. But yeah, I think there's no pressure

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:56.440
as such for DjangoNauts to work, that they have to make a PR, that they have to make

00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:00.800
contributions regularly. So they be part of the program. Everyone can work at their own

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:07.200
pace. And you can also keep communicating with your navigators and your captains to

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.440
let them know what's working for you, what's not working for you. And I think it's a pretty

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:15.800
chill environment out there. So you can just figure out what works for you. So for me,

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:22.320
I think burst of sprints worked for me. So if I take a ticket, I make sure that I get

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.840
something going on and then I take some break and then I come back to Django and I keep

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:33.640
context switching between different open source projects. So that was how I got myself to

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.640
the program.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.600
Excellent. Yeah. If you context switch too frequently, you kind of just never really

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:43.640
get going. You got to be save a little focus and a little deep work on one thing. Sarah,

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:48.880
Tushar mentioned choosing tickets to contribute to. You know, one of the things that's challenging

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.200
about projects like Django or any other project that's been around that long with that many

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:59.280
people using it is it's really complicated. And any part that you, you change can have

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:05.520
really wide ranging consequences, right? You don't want to take down Instagram just for

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:11.240
a commit for contribution. So what I'm getting at is it can be hard as a beginner to find

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.320
the right issues to work on. How do you navigate that?

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:20.160
It is definitely a challenge and it's also a challenge to answer the question because

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:28.400
it's really dependent on the individual and what are your goals? So if you want to like

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:35.800
achieve the, I got a PR merged into Django batch, for example, that's one potential goal

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:43.880
or perhaps you're going, no, I want to be able to have my name again. Like when I see

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:49.320
when Django 5.1 goes out and at the top there's like the major features and like, I want to

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:53.840
have been a part of that or something like that, then it's kind of like a different dynamic

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:59.280
to it. And so if you were one of the individuals where you don't really mind, you just want

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:04.480
to contribute where you can and maybe start small, for example, just to get something

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:10.920
in, then there are different strategies to go about that. But the best strategy in my

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:17.180
opinion is it's really common in, I would say open source in general, that people come

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:26.040
along and they submit a PR that they've done a good piece of work and it gets a PR review

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:30.600
and maybe there were a couple of things that needed changing and then this person, for

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:38.400
whatever reason, they vanish. And probably because of life or whatever it is, or they

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:44.120
just had enough energy to do that. And that's completely fine. And they didn't care about

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.440
it enough to do extra bits or whatever.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.280
It could be they were trying to make Django do something and they decided, you know what,

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.440
I'm going to choose some other framework or even some other language. And they just left

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.600
and they're not going to come back and polish. Like, cause you ask for reviews for better

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.720
documentation and they're like, yeah, no.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:04.280
Exactly. And for example, and you've hit the nail on the head with that because for Django

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:11.880
to accept anything, it needs tests, it needs docs. And so the code itself could be completely

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:17.760
valid already. It could be like the perfect solution for the issue you're trying to solve.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:24.720
But if it was missing the tests and the docs, it wouldn't be accepted. And so what happens

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:30.080
is usually what happens is after a certain period of time, the fellows might do a ping

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.920
to say, ah, do you still want to work on this or something? And then after another period

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:38.520
of time, they close it because it's gone quiet basically.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:45.880
And so there are a bunch of these kind of unfinished starting points that you can swoop

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:52.480
in, take that, and you've already got like some code and it gives you good context with

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:58.120
like, cause sometimes people will share a ticket and they go, I don't even know what

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:05.280
file I should be in to start to do this work. Whereas if you took a PR that's got some code,

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.520
you know what file, what function, you know what's going on there and you've got a lot

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.320
more immediate stuff.

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:16.080
Yeah. Yeah. You're like, this basically works. It needs some polish, maybe a little optimization

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:21.040
and the supporting stuff. Like that's a way smaller project than imagine something you

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.440
could add out of thin air. Right?

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:27.360
Exactly. A hundred percent. And then you can take those and you can, and you can be that

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:32.480
person that pushes, pushes it over the line. And you obviously you credit the original

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:38.280
author. You can put them in the, as a coauthor of the commit and thank them. But it's a really

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:44.640
good place to, to, to build from there. Cause then you can slowly get more context about

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:49.680
what does the process of doing a PR to Django even look like? Because you're going to go

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:55.760
through the PR review and you will learn as you do it, you'll learn how the documentation

00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:02.360
works. You will learn how the tests work and all that kind of stuff. There's quite a, the

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:10.160
contributing docs are quite extensive and scary and it takes a while to absorb all that

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:17.000
information. And for me personally, I have to do it to like really learn it. So I would

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.800
say that's how I would suggest people get started if that was your goal. But, and this

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:31.360
is how I got started, but I would say it makes you like you're so scattered. If I was trying

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:39.120
to gain a really good solid understanding of Django, I have a really weird picture that's

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:44.040
being built that I'm only getting like one pixel at a time in very random spots.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:48.320
Yeah. Maybe really deep down in the code base. You know, like I disconnected. Yeah.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:53.760
I suddenly understand that one thing over there that's really random, but then this

00:34:53.760 --> 00:35:00.720
other completely unrelated thing over here. And so I'm not gaining like a depth of a technical

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:06.240
understanding of one section as a whole. So if you were someone who wanted to have that

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:12.680
star feature that you wanted to have your name against, then really you should go and

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:19.280
pick a section of Django. So if you went into the ticket tracker called track, you can filter

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.480
by components. So an area of Django.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.880
ORM or admin or something like that. Right?

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:30.400
Exactly like this. Exactly like that. And then look at just the tickets for them and

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:38.920
they will be your practical way to get that kind of information. But there's also sometimes

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:43.160
there used to be a conference called Django under the hood and you might find that there

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:50.280
was a talk about forms or something like this. It's maybe relevant and you should build up

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:57.320
your knowledge in like a much longer term perspective that you're focusing on this area.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:04.000
And there might even be like other packages that are related. So perhaps, for example,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.840
David Smith is also a major contributor to Django and he is coming from like a forms

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:15.920
perspective. And he is also a maintainer of Django crispy forms, which gives him a lot

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:24.160
of extra context with how people use forms in Django. And so he can look at tickets and

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:30.640
use that extra way in that knowledge and his opinions whenever people are discussing things.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:36.600
So that's a bit more of like a in-depth deep dive approach, but it might not be the quickest

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.240
way for you to get your first.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:43.680
Yeah, you want to get that first early win or whatever. I really like the idea of reviving

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:47.800
a stale PR. That's pretty clever.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:52.200
This portion of talk Python to me is brought to you by Posit, the makers of Shiny, formerly

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:58.040
R studio and especially shiny for Python. Let me ask you a question. Are you building

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:02.000
awesome things? Of course you are. You're a developer or data scientist. That's what

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.760
we do. And you should check out Posit Connect. Posit Connect is a way for you to publish,

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:12.880
share and deploy all the data products that you're building using Python. People ask me

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:17.320
the same question all the time. Michael, I have some cool data science project or notebook

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:22.800
that I built. How do I share it with my users, stakeholders, teammates, I need to learn fast

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:28.920
API or flask or maybe view or react JS. Hold on now. Those are cool technologies, and I'm

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.400
sure you'd benefit from them. But maybe stay focused on the data project. Let Posit Connect

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:37.880
handle that side of things. With Posit Connect, you can rapidly and securely deploy the things

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:44.840
you build in Python, streamlit, dash, shiny, bokeh, FastAPI, flask, quarto, ports, dashboards

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:50.520
and API's. Posit Connect supports all of them. And Posit Connect comes with all the bells

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:55.960
and whistles to satisfy it and other enterprise requirements. Make deployment the easiest

00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:00.400
step in your workflow with Posit Connect. For a limited time, you can try Posit Connect

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:08.640
for free for three months by going to talkpython.fm/posit. That's talkpython.fm/POSIT. The link is in

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:15.280
your podcast player show notes. Thank you to the team at Posit for supporting Talk Python.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.480
Tim chilling out the audience has a quick question for you, Tushar. Did you ever run

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:23.320
into a wall in the Django code base? How did you handle that? It's very large, very old.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.720
So I imagine parts are hard. I know I get stumped when I try old tickets.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:31.520
I think one of the tickets, one of the issues that are currently out there was an accessibility

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:36.320
ticket. So basically we want to increase the accessibility of the Django admin. This is

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:40.680
something that I also found it quite interesting because it was a very interesting problem

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:47.880
to build a CI/CD pipeline that will take care of accessibility.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:52.640
When you say accessibility, are you talking multilingual? Are you talking screen reader?

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:53.640
What are you talking?

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:58.320
Django serves a very large diverse audience and there could be people who are disabled.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:02.680
There could be people who are colorblind. So you have to take care of putting out a

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:08.400
software that also caters to the needs of those people as well. So accessibility is

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:13.320
different. Yeah. So basically there's a lot of things in that. There's a specification

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:18.720
that's out there to define what is a good accessible software. And you can have a CI/CD

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:24.840
that checks your code, your project with that software, with that specifications.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:30.080
So I think that was a very open-ended ticket and I faced a very big wall on how to approach

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:35.480
that, what all is needed there. And the thing that I did was I reached out to my navigator

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:40.280
and captains when I was in the program and they actually got me connected to the right

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:44.640
people and the right person to ping. So the track, they assigned the right people in the

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:49.040
track that should have been in the ticket. And I think someone from the Django accessibility

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:55.800
team came in, they gave me weekly updates on what's the current status of this ticket.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.200
What are we planning? They told me that this is going to be a low-chain ticket. It will

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:04.080
spread out over a month because we are planning on how to do this correctly. And I think,

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:09.320
yeah, that's how I was able to get past that. The ticket is still open. There's another

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:13.560
package that has been abandoned, but we are trying to bring it in the Django ecosystem,

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:20.680
I think. So I think Mark is working on that. That's how I basically get past the paywall,

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.920
like the wall of getting the contribution.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:29.640
And I think most of the time, navigators were very helpful because they have a lot of contribution

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:35.080
and they also helped me in pointing to the right location, where should I look to? So

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:39.800
I think one of the times I reached out to Sarah to just know why this specific ticket

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.680
was closed. And I was not able to find what went wrong so that this PR was reverted. And

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:49.640
she pointed out to the right, the backtracking PR that you should take a look at. So this

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:53.320
is how I generally just reach out because that's what the program is for.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:58.960
That highlights a super big advantage or benefit of it, right? A normal contributor can't just

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:04.800
make all these connections or even necessarily know who was involved in the original effort,

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.200
why was it shut down? Is it something the project doesn't want or did people abandon

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:12.960
it or none of that is accessible from the less accessible from the outside.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.160
Yes, I completely agree.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:19.120
So people have been listening, maybe they're pretty excited to be part of it. Do you have

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:22.200
another cohort coming along? When's the next one?

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:27.960
Okay, so we are just starting the first of the year that starts on the 15th of January.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:31.640
So if you wanted, if this is the first time you've heard about it, unfortunately, you're

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:36.920
not in the industry. And that one's pretty much left the station.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:42.600
Well, I have a benefit for you that with a little bit of podcasting time travel. So this

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:47.320
probably won't come out for six weeks. So on the main audio, although it's already on

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:53.000
YouTube for folks listening there, so it'll be a little closer to the start of the one

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.560
after if there's going to be a third.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:42:01.480
Okay, interesting. Thank you for that tip. The best place to check at any point if you

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:06.760
wanted to check if there is, if we're accepting applications for a session is you could go

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:15.260
to the Djangonaut space website and then click on sessions. And when you click on sessions,

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:21.480
you will see exactly right now you can see that the session that we have is if you scroll

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:27.960
a bit further down on the screen, we're sharing the session and you can see the latest information

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:34.340
of the applications when it starts and all the details about that particular session.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:41.480
And so whenever we agree to do a new session that will appear on our website and there

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:48.560
will be this apply button essentially when applications are open. So in six weeks time

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:56.720
that that might be the case that we are accepting new applications. There is also a interest

00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:03.900
form that we have. So again, on there's yes, if you click back on sessions at the top,

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:14.820
there is a join us secret button. Yeah, exactly. Top tip. And here you can send us your email.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:20.180
And what this just means is we will send you an email as soon as applications open for

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:24.800
the next session. And then you will be the first to know. The other thing is, is we're

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:33.400
on social media. We're on X and Mastodon and LinkedIn. So followers on all of those places.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:38.360
And we, you will, we will also post there for everything when, when that's.

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:43.260
Yeah, definitely. And I'll put those in the podcast show notes so people can click on

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:47.960
them and find all these things. It also seems you all are on YouTube. What happens over

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:52.700
on YouTube? We are on YouTube and amazingly we, we gained some followers before we've

00:43:52.700 --> 00:44:01.560
even really done anything, but this is our plan. So also in session, we have a couple

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:10.320
of guests speakers who come and the Django notes can, they will usually talk about some

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:16.420
topic and they've got some particular experiences that they can share and that you have a little

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:22.880
bit of a Q and a with them. So in the pilot session, both Marish and Natalia, who are

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:30.160
the two Django fellows, they had a session with our Django notes and we record these

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:37.060
sessions and what we want to do is we want to publish these on YouTube to make that available

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:43.340
to everybody because there's quite interesting information that gets shared in these talks

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:49.720
and the whole aim of open sources to, to share information really. So that is the main plan

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:54.960
for the YouTube channel, but we're not there yet, but maybe by the time the podcast is

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.800
published, there will be a few weeks.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:03.360
That's cool. So people can smash the subscribe and crush the bell over there. That'll be

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:09.180
cool. So how many people are in the next cohort? The 20, 24 first cohort.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:15.860
There is 18 Django notes. So we've really scaled up since the pilot. Yeah. So that's

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:20.860
six teams. Whereas last time we had two teams, so quite a few more.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:26.060
Yeah. That's cool. What's the Ross team story, right? Like I can imagine say like some kind

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:29.940
of startup accelerator where there's groups and, but sometimes they get together and present

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:33.140
to each other what they're building, what they're doing. Like, is there something like

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:36.980
that where the teams cross pollinate or whatever?

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:41.260
Yeah, we have, you're in the same discord and we have channels that are available to

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:48.420
everybody and we are trying to achieve a community feel and that you can work with other people.

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:54.400
So we do have a, a life channel where people share things about, I don't know that they

00:45:54.400 --> 00:46:00.340
went on a run. It's a little bit more around the humanizing individual and all this kind

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:07.540
of stuff. But there are channels which are about works work, I say, but you know, contributing

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:13.660
specifically so on tickets and people can share the work that they're doing and say,

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:18.900
Hey, I want some input on this or does anybody want to work together with me on that? And

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:24.420
there's nothing stopping a Django knot from working with another Django knot who's in

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:31.460
a different team. The team is just a structure to give you a group that is manageable for,

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:37.900
for one human to look after and for you to have a meaningful discussion in a, in a smaller

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:38.900
group.

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:42.100
We get so big, it just becomes a bunch of anonymous people that happen to be in the

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:45.980
same program. Yeah. William out there has an interesting question. As you talk about

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:51.340
adding more than before, what are your plans on scaling this and what do you feel are limiting

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:52.340
factors?

00:46:52.340 --> 00:47:00.020
That's a really awesome question, William. So limiting factors are usually getting mentors

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:08.140
who agree to do it at the same time. And it's interesting as to whether we continue to organize

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:15.340
it that it's a session that everyone is there at the same time, or whether we allow it to

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:21.260
no longer be a single cohort and that somebody could be like, right, there's two people who

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:26.220
are available from this state to this state and therefore they can look after a few Django

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:33.000
knots. For example, that could be an option for us to prevent this larger cohort because

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.660
it means that we're trying to get a group of, I don't know, eight volunteers who can

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:45.340
all do this time period at the same time. That's a challenge. And we did struggle to,

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:52.180
we got a reasonable amount of people raise their hands to be mentors, but we could always

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:59.220
do with more of them. So if anyone wants to do that, that's, we'd love to hear from you.

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:05.040
So that's another thing that kind of limits that scale. And the other thing is, is we

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:13.260
are learning the challenges as we go. So fortunately we haven't had any issues yet. We have, for

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:18.300
example, a code of conduct and there is a way that people could report something that

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:24.740
we should be aware of. And we haven't had that report yet. Touch wood, it will never

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:30.540
happen, but there's some things that we, it will take a few iterations for us to really

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:37.180
test, stress test our processes and check that this is going to be capable of scale.

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.500
But yeah, who knows? We're not there yet.

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:45.340
Well, you know what? One positive feedback loop is people like Tushar who went through

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:48.340
it, but now are supporting its growth, right?

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:49.340
Yeah, definitely.

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:55.860
Yeah. And a question for you from Sarah Shars, I saw multiple or at least one person out

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.720
in the audience saying, Hey, I'm going to be in the next cohort. So do you have any

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:03.660
advice as a former Django-Naut for new ones who are about to get started?

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:08.860
Yeah, I think one of the important advices would be to have a lot of fun. You can contribute

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:14.980
to Django, but also you make a lot of good connections. So also like be around in the

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:20.900
Django discord, Django-Nauts discord, interact with people, talk with each other, attend

00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:25.540
the sessions, just get to know people, just get to know them a lot. Because the three

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:32.060
weeks, the four, the amount of time that you'll part of the Django-Naut program will be, they'll

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:37.660
focus on getting you left off, but you should plan on making this program more sustainable.

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:42.260
So just try to be around, keep talking with different people and have fun.

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:46.480
Good advice. All right, let's round this out with what are the benefits for the people

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:52.220
who are participating? And I suppose also navigators and captains. One thing I see here

00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:58.460
that would be really a bonus is just the edge it gives you in working in web development

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:05.340
and Python as a job opportunity going forward, right? If you say, yes, I know how to do a

00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:10.300
database query with the Django ORM, please hire me. That's one thing. It's another to

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:15.500
say, I added that feature that you're excited about. Can we talk about my position? Right?

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.660
Okay. Everyone else is off the table, as long as you're a decent fit, right? Like that all

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:24.860
of a sudden just puts you in a different stratosphere, I guess, sticking with the theme. So maybe

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:29.380
you all could speak a little bit to advantages beyond just, I want to contribute to open

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:31.700
source and have the badge or whatever it is.

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:36.940
Yeah, absolutely. I think my first job was, my first job was basically like no interviews

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:43.320
just based on open source profile. The company or the current company that I'm part of also

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:47.860
have some open source products. So I was just involved with that. And the job was just a

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:52.540
simple like one-on-one kinds of conversations on what are the projects or different opposites

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:53.540
contributions.

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:56.820
They're like, Hey, it's a shark. It seems like you're doing this for free. How about

00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:00.580
we pay you to do this? Okay. You convinced me.

00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:07.060
Yeah. So yeah, that's, that's what actually happened. I think you'll get a lot of, I mean,

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:10.660
contributing to open source, you get a lot of visibility. There are a lot of people that

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:17.060
reach out to you. And I think the best part of it is, as I said it before, you, you just

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:21.900
grow compoundly. There's no stopping when you get started with these stuff. Initially,

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:26.140
there's a barrier that you have to push before you get started. But I think Django will do

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:31.260
that work for you to help you push that initial barrier, get the inertia moving. And then

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:34.220
it's all just a good walk down the path.

00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:41.140
Even beyond getting your first job or getting your foot in the door, or if you're with certain

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:45.700
roles, you might come to a point where there's usually this learning curve, right? Where

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:50.780
at the start you learn loads and then it really levels off and you've become efficient and

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:57.340
you kind of know the processes and you've been asked to make yet another API endpoint

00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:03.580
for something. And it's kind of fairly, you're not learning so much as you were in the early

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:04.580
days.

00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:07.700
Go with me here. What we need is we're going to need a grid of things in the database and

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:11.940
I need you to be able to edit in the, okay. Like the five other ones I just built. Got

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:13.660
it. Okay. That kind of thing. Yeah. Okay.

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:19.940
I also get it that, you know, and companies don't necessarily want you to experiment too

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:24.980
much because experiments are risky and all this kind of stuff. So depending on when you

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:30.500
work, maybe you've got lots of opportunities to, to learn lots of new stuff, but some people

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:35.740
will be in a position where actually they go, Oh, I don't feel like I've learned anything

00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:42.700
this year or something like that. And I think open source or contributed to Django particularly,

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:49.980
like there's, it's so big and there's so much there that you can really learn about if you

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:56.900
want to. And completely with no pressure, your own pace and with really friendly people.

00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:03.420
And so there is, you know, if you engage in that as a practice, it can also give that

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:08.500
you the joy of programming again, that you can go, you know what, this is a really tough

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:13.140
problem and I can really think about this. And it's not like a problem that's screaming

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:17.980
at me that needs to be like fixed straight away or whatever. But you know, and I think

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:20.740
there's lots of those opportunities in there too.

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:24.860
It's always a struggle as you get to work for some company and they're like, yeah, we're

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:28.300
not changing that. That works. We're not messing with that. We're not ready for Python two

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:35.260
seven yet. We're still on two six. So let's just calm down there. Okay. Sure. I see some

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:40.660
other people asking, is this a discord? This is a private discord for the cohort. It's

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:43.100
not something public that others can participate in.

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:47.980
That's true. There is a Django discord that is public to everybody and I would recommend

00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:53.540
joining there. So please do. And a lot of people are in both. And if you dropped into

00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:59.460
the contributing, getting started channel or the contributor discussions channel, and

00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:04.100
you were to talk about a ticket, it's very likely that I and other Django contributors

00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:10.020
are going to engage with you directly. So there's that, but the Django not space discord

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:17.140
is designed for the cohort to give people a little bit of a smaller community feel and

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:22.820
allow them to feel comfortable sharing the pictures of their dogs and things like that,

00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:26.620
that when they're very new to this. So yeah, that's how it's working.

00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:32.420
Excellent. All right. Let's wrap this up really quick with just one broader thing. Maybe there's

00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:37.420
many other communities out there listening. I wish we had a, a not some kind of astronaut

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:41.900
type thing for us. What advice would you give to other open source communities that maybe

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.260
want to have this type of thing?

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:49.500
Give it a go. I really try out. I think we're very happy for people to take, I mean, all

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:54.380
of our documentations are on a GitHub. It's all open source. Please take it and make it

00:54:54.380 --> 00:55:01.300
your own. You can use different names and keep in touch with us and tell us what works

00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:09.540
for you and what you've changed and what's better. And yeah, for us, we wanted to start

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:17.140
off with something quite lightweight and basic. And when we started, for example, we, okay,

00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:22.700
we had a name, but no one knew who we were because we just invented it. And for example,

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:27.720
with Tashar, we reached out to some individuals. So in the past, when we'd seen some people

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:32.340
be interested, we, those were the first people we contacted. So you can start really small,

00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:36.820
really basic. You don't have to have a launch where you're accepting applications. Cause

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:40.300
when you have applications, you need to figure out what does an application even look like

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:42.300
and then how are you going to review it?

00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:43.300
Yeah.

00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:48.740
A hundred percent. So start small and then you can build it out in a way that works for

00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:50.940
you and see how it goes.

00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:55.780
All right. Well, excellent. I think that's probably it for all the time we have today,

00:55:55.780 --> 00:56:00.780
but I want to congratulate you both on this really cool community you built and are building.

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:04.380
Final call to action. People are excited about Django Nauts. What do you tell them?

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:10.740
Oh, just followers on our social media and please do apply when we have sessions. We

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:16.380
really, really appreciate all the applications that we receive and mentors are always wanted

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:19.380
and needed. So get in touch. Yeah, please.

00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:24.680
Yeah. Of course. Go to the session section and click join us and fill out the form if

00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:29.740
you think you might in the future want to be part of it. Right. Indeed. All right. Sarah
