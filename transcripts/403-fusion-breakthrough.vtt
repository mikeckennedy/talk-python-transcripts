00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.360
Imagine a world with free and unlimited clean energy.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.140
That's the musings of a great science fiction story, isn't it?

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.880
But nuclear fusion, the kind that powers the sun, has always been close at hand.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.820
We see the sun every day, and yet impossibly far away as a technology.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.980
However, we took a major step towards this becoming a reality

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.820
when the folks at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the U.S. achieved ignition,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.160
where they got significantly more energy out than they put in.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.480
And Python played a major role in this research and experiment.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.780
We have Jay Solomansson here to give us a look at the science and the Python code of this discovery.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.860
Also, I've linked a five-minute YouTube video explaining the details

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.060
and showing this massive machine that they used.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.520
It's worth watching before you listen further.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.160

Jay, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.740
Thanks for having me, Michael.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.760
Pleasure to be here.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.040
It's a pleasure to have you.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.800
Congratulations.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.960
Thanks.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.380
Thanks.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.840
And of course, I would be remiss if I didn't totally qualify that, that any congrats have

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.900
to be accepted on behalf of hundreds of people at the NIF, at the laboratory and laboratories

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.720
and industry around, and indeed extending back six decades of research that went into this.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.380
And so my part is insignificant, but not negligible.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.600
I'm having a couple of my mental models broken recently.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.840
For me, fusion has always been one of those things that's always 30 years out.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.220
It's like, oh, we know it's possible, but it's just, we're really barely scratching the surface.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.440
And the other mental model is AI is always 30 years out as well.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.040
And this year of ChatGP and stable diffusion and all those things.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.940
Things are changing.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.300
Yeah.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.640
And this huge breakthrough that you all had.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.460
I'm sure there's still work to be done.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.780
You're not there yet, right?

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.760
We're not all driving around with little tiny, you know, water-powered cars and stuff, but

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.060
it shows that it's possible, right?

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.040
And that it's a massive deal.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.340
Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.140
There are a couple of big changes here in the last, in just months even, right?

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.180
So I'm still kind of processing both of those, actually.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.100
So yeah, it's going to be an interesting world.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.000
I think, you know, as far as ignition, well, you know, it is still a long, long path forward

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.320
towards utilization.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.780
We can talk about that.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.280
Yeah, we will, but it's so exciting because with renewables, that's great, but there's

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.040
always a cost to that in terms of like, well, just, you know, big solar panels, like the

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.240
mountains of e-waste of those things as they deteriorate over time or just getting them all

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.560
produced.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.620
But I think this is different and I'm super excited to be diving into it with you.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.700
I'm also really interested to hear how Python played an interesting role in it.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.000
Yeah.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.420
Yeah.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.140
I think that's a kind of a fun story.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.360
And so I'm happy to have a chance to share it.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.600
Yeah.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.100
And you've been central to it, which is, it's fantastic.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.520
Now, before we get into all that, let's get into your story.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.460
How'd you get into, I guess, physics as well as Python?

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.280
Yeah.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.640
Yeah.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.720
So I was, you know, always wanted to be a scientist growing up, you know, as a little

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.000
kid, it was always space and dinosaurs and dinosaurs and space and all.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.840
And that's how it sort of started.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.420
And then I remembered it's actually just about this time, about 40 years ago or so, you know,

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.500
my dad brought home a Commodore 64.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.080
So this would have been the after Christmas buzz of learning basic and stuff, my sister

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.420
and I.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.180
And so that really started my, you know, computational journey.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.540
And then fast forwarding to, I got a degree in physics from Montana State University, did

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.180
a cosmology with Bill Hiscock there.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.700
And then I moved to California, took some time off.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.900
I worked at Chevron and the geophysics staff for a couple of years, met my wife there,

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.140
worked at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View for a year.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.640
Then I decided to go back to school, which is what I always wanted to do.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.540
I looked around.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.620
I didn't really want to move very much.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.320
I was in the East Bay and San Francisco Bay Area.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.140
It's nice there.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.620
It is nice there.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.460
You have a family as well, right?

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.880
Which makes it, that can always be a tricky balance.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.800
Yeah, exactly.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.320
Exactly.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.600
That's always a constraint.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.520
And ultimately, it's a fairly stupid reason to make decisions.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.820
But it actually worked out very well because it made me look around.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.380
And it turned out there was this amazing graduate program at this place called Morris Livermore

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.180
National Laboratory run through the UC Davis, University of California, Davis, called the Department

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.860
of Applied Science.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.620
And so I ended up going there for five years for a PhD and studied gamma ray bursts, the

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.100
largest explosions in the universe from across the universe.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.660
They send their high energy radiation from these giant relativistic mysterious explosions.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.440
It's very exciting.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:51.280
And I worked on modeling, doing a numerical modeling of neutron stars in their last few orbits

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.180
in a few milliseconds before they coalesce as the defunct model for gamma ray bursts at the

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.440
time.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.960
But it was a great experience programming in C++ and doing general relativity and such.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.100
And then I did a postdoc after that.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.980
And I got involved with another code at the lab that's actually people who are interested

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.980
in numerical astrophysics might look into.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.880
It's called Cosmos++ with Peter Aninos and Chris Fregil at College of Charleston.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.740
Again, C++ doing more gamma ray burst research and such.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:26.100
And that's what I did until about 20 years ago when I took a job at Ignition with the ICF

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.900
campaign, the inertial confinement fusion campaign.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.040
And that's where I've basically been ever since.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.900
Then things sort of switched gears.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.060
I basically kind of, I still worked with Cosmos++ for a few years part time.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.340
But really, I kind of retired my compiled efforts and went more towards the interpreted world and

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.400
got more involved in that.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.180
Because then in ICF, the whole point was NIF was being built.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.120
It was still a hole in the ground at the time.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.020
And there are these big multi-physics codes.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.300
That's what we use at the lab to kind of research our ideas, to run them in simulation, see what

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.720
they'll do.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.360
And we use interpreted languages to interface with those, either to run the code to help

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.200
steer it, if you will, but also to post-process.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.060
And so I got really involved with a few languages.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.820
And Python didn't actually come to the fore at first.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.560
I was introduced with Python a little bit in the 90s.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.700
I wrote a little cron job that went to the weather service and put a weather map of my background

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.340
every hour, which I thought was pretty nifty.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.180
And so I saw that it had potential.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.480
But one of the languages that I was first introduced to was Yorick, which was actually written

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.100
by a physicist at Livermore, Dave Monroe.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.700
And so it's fairly extensively used at the lab.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.880
And it actually is.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.160
It has a causal connection to particularly the numpy library in Python.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.180
I also actually got pretty involved in Perl at the time.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.160
Something about it sort of appealed to me.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.220
I sort of liked its lexical structure.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.340
You know, Larry Wall is a linguist and all.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.860
But definitely for the last 10 years or so, the weak couplings that are appealing about

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.620
Python just kept coming back.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.080
And so I've since bitten down on that hook and drank Goulade pretty readily.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.020
And so for the last 10 years or so, it's been all Python all the time.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:04.980
Nice.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.100
Yeah.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.720
Now you've just got to tattoo the Python logo and it's no going back.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.200
Exactly.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.380
Got it.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.180
You have one, right?

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.480
That's right.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.780
I keep my whole back.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.800
Right, right.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.880
One thing that stands out with that story, which is really interesting, I think it seems to

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:27.560
me like there's quite a move in the sciences in general to move more towards open source

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.780
and more towards sharing in terms of, hey, if you use this library and we use that library,

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.680
then maybe we can both have a better library type of sharing.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.220
Yeah.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:42.180
And that's something that I've been fortunate enough to kind of watch happen over the course

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.320
of these years.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.400
And I think, you know, we see that it's nonlinear.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.560
It's just exploding.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:54.240
You know, I think one of the appeals of Python has been, you know, PyPI and just this proliferation

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:54.980
of packages.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:55.360
Right.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.820
I mean, shout out your Python Bytes podcast.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.720
I find that to be quite fun and almost overwhelming the new things that are coming out all the time.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.780
And, you know, you got to kind of keep up and pick and choose.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.480
But there's all sorts of new things.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.380
And, you know, the paradigm has shifted for me and I think a lot of people, right, where,

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.060
oh, I have this thing to do.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.400
I better start doing that or crack a book or whatever.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.520
But no, it's like, let's find the package that already does that.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.000
And that's just a fundamental shift.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.080
And it's actually a lot of fun, I think.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.760
And you can contribute to it as well.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.980
Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.840
I feel like when I went to school, I just took one or two, just maybe one or two.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.860
I certainly won, maybe two computer science type classes.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:40.860
And it was all about algorithms and how can you evaluate, oh, this bubble sort versus that

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.720
or this data structure versus that.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.260
And it seems a lot less, not that that's relevant, but it seems way more important now to,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.500
oh, I can evaluate these libraries and pick this library.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.420
And it probably does something great inside, but I don't need to worry about it, right?

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:59.120
It's more building with Lego blocks than it is, you know, building with wiring kits.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.520
I don't know.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.660
Like, you know, it's more big pieces that you just put together.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.560
And, you know, kind of just to tie in, you know, the very first inklings of what ChatGPT

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.160
and, you know, and Copilot and stuff can bring.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.660
I mean, you know, I think Andre Carpathie made the comment that the new interpret language

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.940
is English, right?

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.800
And it's almost getting to that point where we can just almost dictate what we want, you

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.860
know, which is sort of the next level of abstraction.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.380
You know, I think that's just going to happen now, right?

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.000
Yeah, it's, we're past the 30 years, I guess, and it's starting to get crazy.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.620
So I think this is really a positive move for the sciences in general, that so many of these

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.900
libraries are available.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:39.560
And now you have thousands or millions of people working on it and using it, not just a single

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.200
research lab.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:40.560
Yeah.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.840
And it's nice to actually see, you know, I think from my little vantage point, I'm not

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.580
always aware of it, but the lab, Livermore, for instance, and I think all the labs participate,

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.220
there's an, they release a wealth of open source software as well.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.180
So it tends to be fairly focused on high performance computing.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:00.760
You know, it has a niche, but it's, but it's definitely, we're trying to give back and

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.000
be part of that conversation.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by TypePy.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.920
TypePy is the next generation open source Python application builder.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.960
With TypePy, you can turn data and AI algorithms into full web apps in no time.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.960
Here's how it works.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.040
You start with a bare algorithm written in Python.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:26.220
You then use TypePy's innovative tool set that enables Python developers to build interactive

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.920
end user applications quickly.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.500
There's a visual designer to develop highly interactive GUIs ready for production.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:37.280
And for inbound data streams, you can program against the TypePy core layer as well.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.740
TypePy core provides intelligent pipeline management, data caching, and scenario and cycle management

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.280
facilities.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.340
That's it.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:49.440
You'll have transformed a bare algorithm into a full-fledged decision support system for

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:49.960
end users.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:55.300
TypePy is pure Python and open source, and you install it with a simple pip install TypePy.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.880
For large organizations that need fine-grained control and authorization around their data,

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.300
there is a paid TypePy Enterprise Edition.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.140
But the TypePy core and GUI described above is completely free to use.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:11.220
Learn more and get started by visiting talkpython.fm/taipy.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.900
That's T-A-I-P-Y.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.180
The links in your show notes.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.020
Thank you to TypePy for sponsoring the show.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:24.620
Well, let's start our conversation and our exploration here with some science, and then we'll get back

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.780
down to the Python inside of it.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:27.140
Yeah.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:33.800
Let's talk about just all the stuff that's led up to fusion in general, and then the science

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.340
and the attempts that have led up to this great breakthrough.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:36.760
Yeah.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:44.140
So, like I mentioned, actually, you know, laser-induced fusion has been a research area for six decades

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.140
at the lab.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.400
I mean, when the first ideas were starting, when the first lasers were around and the first

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.600
people started thinking about that as a driver for fusion.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.080
And again, this concept of fusion is inertial confinement fusion.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.700
It's sort of based on the concept of taking some hydrogen isotopes.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.360
We tend to use deuterium and tritium.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.840
Those are the heavier versions of hydrogen because they have a higher cross-section for

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.880
fusion reacting.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.660
And we implode them.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.220
So, yes, you have a diagram here that you're showing.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:18.400
So, we have a capsule rather than that distinct from magnetic fusion, which is sort of the other

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:23.280
camp where it's a little bit more like the fluorescent bulb model for fusion where you're running

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:29.000
plasma through a torus or some sort of a manifold like that, making it very hot but at low density

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.480
and maybe something a little more akin to the corona of the sun, say, and fusion will happen there

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.820
in those schemes.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:41.120
And then here, we're actually taking all of the fuel and putting it inside of one little capsule.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:47.340
And then we're compressing that capsule, getting it to very dense as opposed to fusion or magnetic

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.680
fusion, which is low density, very dense and hot conditions where fusion can transpire.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.980
It's actually sort of analogous, I think, to an internal combustion engine in that regard.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.080
So, we're actually, you know, driving fusion.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.900
It happens and it blows itself apart.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:06.520
The graphics that I had seen largely were those big torus-like structures.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.720
Was it...

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.960
There's a name for that, the T.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.740
Well, there's Tokamax and Spheramax.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.200
Yeah, there's several concepts out there.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:13.620
Right.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.060
That's the one.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.500
So, those I think is probably...

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.720
Yeah, that's probably what a lot of people are familiar with.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.060
Mm-hmm.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:18.440
Mm-hmm.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:25.440
This project is focused on aiming a bunch of lasers at a really small point and just

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.520
really compressing it and heating it all at once, right?

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.140
Exactly.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:33.260
So, you know, just to kind of, I guess, give the outline, just like you said.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:38.260
So, the NIF is a big, big stadium-sized facility at the northeast corner of Lawrence-Livermore

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.160
National Laboratory.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.480
And in it, it is filled with 192 gigantic beams.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.200
Each one of them is basically one of the largest laser facilities in the world.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.940
And there are 192 of them.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:55.080
They each basically work in concert to shine a pulse of just a few nanoseconds long.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.760
And this pulse goes down and it is kind of as the graphic you show.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.780
They all are basically trying to converge at a point.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:06.600
But rather than just a point, what we put at the center of this convergence of all these

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.540
192 beams is a little tiny gold can.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:13.860
And so, the can is about a centimeter high and maybe half a centimeter wide.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:19.060
And on the top and bottom, you put these two little holes in the no-enculture, the laser

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.880
entrance holes that LEH is.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:27.060
And so, it's rather amazing, these 192 beams of gigantic lasers.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.140
And when they're being amplified, they're actually several feet across.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.400
So, the beams are spread out.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.120
They're huge.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.560
But they all get focused down to the point where they can all go through just a couple

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.540
millimeter-sized hole, both at the top and the bottom of this gold can.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.380
And they shine into the can and they shine on the inside wall of the can.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.100
And their goal is then to heat the can, right?

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.120
So, you start with this laser light and then you want to heat this can.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.280
And in this can, we refer to it as a holerum.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:57.060
That's a German word that translates roughly to hollow room.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.860
And that's just simply because it's something that holds the heat.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.020
And holerums are actually everywhere in our life, right?

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.200
Our ovens are a holerum.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.420
Ovens heat up to temperatures of our infrared temperatures, right?

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.840
We can sort of feel that heat.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.140
We can't see it, but we can feel it.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:17.800
You know, if you get up, we heat these little holerums up to actually x-ray temperatures.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.140
So, they're so hot, they're beyond visual.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.220
They're beyond ultraviolet, but into the x-rays.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:27.220
And it's actually a fraction of the temperature at the center of the sun, in fact.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:34.100
And so, we're actually bathing this little tiny gold can within this superheated x-ray environment.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:39.200
And then we inserted inside of that holerum beforehand a hapless little capsule.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.320
And this capsule is about two millimeters across.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:42.400
It has no idea what's coming.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.340
Exactly.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.840
You know, you kind of feel sorry for it.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.120
You anthropomorphize it a little bit.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:55.620
But this capsule is made of, it's a very, very thin shell, just a couple hundred microns or 100 or so microns thick.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:01.600
And right now, these shots are being, actually, they're used nanocrystalline diamonds.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.820
So, they're like pure carbon shells.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.320
And so, they're very dense.

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.840
And so, it's kind of funny.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.020
We have a gold holerum.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.140
The holerum is made out of gold and the capsule is made out of diamond, right?

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.220
So, could you have picked more prosaic ingredients?

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.260
But these are the ones that work.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:21.460
And so, the point of this capsule is really just, it acts like a rocket fuel.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:26.780
And so, what happens is the laser energy is absorbed into that diamond and it explodes.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.780
It just does pretty much exactly what you'd kind of think.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.660
It just, it heats and explodes.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.400
And then, you know, going back to your Newton's third law, right?

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.180
So, if you have an action, for a reaction, there has to be an equal and opposite reaction.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:43.080
If you have this little capsule exploding outward, right?

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:47.700
In this bath of x-rays, whatever you put inside of that capsule has to go inward.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:53.180
And happily, we were really, we actually put in a little bit of deuterium and tritium.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.780
And we actually froze it into an ice layer around the inside of that capsule.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.320
So, that becomes our payload.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.940
So, it's the spherical rocket analogy is actually very apt.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:07.120
So, you're actually, you're having this fuel blowing outward and causing thrust that pushes

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:11.420
the payload inward and you try to compress it into a tiny little pellet.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:16.120
Again, trying to achieve very, very high densities, hundreds of grams per cubic centimeter and

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.020
tens of kilovolts.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.020
That's no one in clature.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.020
We can talk more about that.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:23.500
But to get to the point, we're actually at fusion conditions.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:28.340
And what you're looking for and the goal, the reason why we're talking right now is you're

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.980
always, the goal was always to achieve an ignition.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.220
So, for a very long time, people have demonstrated that you can get neutrons out of this.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:42.220
You can actually get a few of the billions or, well, billions of billions of hydrogen atoms

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.280
in there to fuse.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:48.000
But what we're trying to do is get to the point where they bootstrap, where one fusion can cause

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.400
another fusion or several more fusions, which will cause more fusions.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.200
And you get what's called an ignition.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.620
And it's ignition wave where actually the fusions will cause more fusions.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:01.360
And they'll actually cause a burn propagating from the tiny center of that little assembled

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:06.040
piece of fuel, move outward and actually, you know, propagate and burn fuel as it goes out.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:11.000
And that way you can actually, you know, that's, that way you get a macroscopic amount of the

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.120
fuel to burn, to convert to helium and release fusion energy, release neutrons.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.680
And that's, that's what we finally achieved.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.520
It's extremely difficult because basically everything has to work perfectly.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:31.940
192 lasers and probably a chaotic dynamic reaction of some form of explosion and interaction there.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.640
It's not super easy to control.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.740
And there's some interesting Python planning some of those experiments and stuff.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.760
But it sounds to me that it's, even though it's in a sense, very much the opposite of fission,

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:47.980
traditional nuclear reactions that we already leverage, the way that it kind of propagates.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.680
And once you get it going, it sounds actually oddly similar.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.120
Yeah.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.600
I mean, the fission, fission, the good thing about it is, or the nice thing about it is that it's

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.440
passive, right?

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.520
But it does operate in that same idea.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.660
If you put, you know, fission products are really close together and one goes off, then it might

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.040
cause others to go off and you can get that chain reaction.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.220
And exactly.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.660
That's, we're trying to get that to happen with, with fusion.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:14.100
But the thing is that, you know, fusion, these particles are so light and they, they're all like

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:14.940
charges, right?

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.700
So they're always trying to push each other away.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:21.520
And as soon as you start putting heat into it, the product of fusion, the thing you wanted

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.760
to get out of it, it immediately blows itself apart and turns itself off.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.720
Unlike fission.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.100
That's really kind of always the trick.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:29.920
That's the hard part.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.140
Yeah.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:30.800
Yeah, exactly.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:36.740
So you have to really carefully balance the lasers to, to keep the confinement happening

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.380
and keep the pressure there until it takes off, right?

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.040
The lasers are short shrift.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.720
Unfortunately, there's, they're just amazing technological achievements, frankly.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.680
And I'm, I'm only just, you know, I, I know a little bit about them.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.080
I know enough about them to simulate them, but they're amazing technological achievements that

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.840
you can get all of these to run together.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.100
And what they do is actually they give it, they give this blast, right?

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.640
They heat the, the whole room and they actually heat it, not just like turn it 450, like your

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:01.820
oven.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:06.400
They actually heat it in these very precise stages that are timed all over the course of

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:11.880
this few nanoseconds to actually, you're actually trying to, to ablate this, this rocket

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.380
fuel in steps.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.940
You're not just trying to just blam.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.340
You're just actually in, and doing that, you do that very precisely.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:22.160
So you're actually blowing a first step and then you do another step and then you actually

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.140
hit it harder and really give it a good hard drive to really implode it.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.960
And all of that is happening by basically the light, the lasers over the course of these

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.900
few nanoseconds, just sort of pulsing in a sense, if you will, to heat this whole room,

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:35.880
you know, in these stages.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.080
So all of that has to be just perfect.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.420
It has to be very uniform.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:44.660
And then that's, ends up driving this, this capsule and the capsule doesn't want to actually

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.220
implode.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.020
And that's another big thing is, is it's, it's unstable.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.700
You never, nature doesn't want to take nature.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.120
They always say nature hates a vacuum.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.600
Nature also hates when you take every, all the room, all atoms in a room and try to move

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.940
them into one corner, right?

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.520
It doesn't let you do that easily, right?

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.500
And that's basically kind of what we're trying to do.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:07.120
We're trying to take all of these fusion, these hydrogens and, and put them all together

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.860
into a tiny, tiny space.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.280
And kind of like you'd imagine just trying to press a balloon together.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:17.460
We're trying to implode this capsule by a factor of 30 in linear scale, 20 to 30.

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.140
You know, if you tried to take a balloon and do that, right?

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:24.960
You can imagine you push it in and it pops out where your, your fingers don't, you know,

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.940
where your fingers aren't.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.380
So you bring in a friend and they, you push together and you're all pushing together.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:33.960
And pretty soon the balloon is finding tiny little places to squeeze out, but, but it's

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.640
going to find them.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:34.880
Right.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.720
And so you have to just basically iteratively, you know, make everything as perfect as possible.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:45.260
And so the other hero of this achievement, not just the lasers, the lasers have been just

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:50.760
going through these rather miraculous increments beyond their original design specs to the point

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.440
where they're, they're delivering more energy than they were originally promised.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:23:00.180
And with, with unprecedented smoothness and precision, but also the capsule and its smoothness and

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.160
perfection is amazing.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.040
So like this capsule, these capsules, if you just sort of think of out of roundness, they're

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.820
about 200 nanometers, maybe out of round, out of, out of a millimeter.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:16.180
And, you know, the earth is roughly, you know, 20 kilometers out of, out of round, out of 6,000.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.140
So these are, if you do those ratios, this, this is actually about 10 times rounder than

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:21.600
the earth.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.040
Wow.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.480
And, you know, and it's just a tiny little, you know, two millimeters across a capsule.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:26.980
Right.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.020
So they're, they're very, very smooth.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.940
And that's something that's, that's been progressing.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:35.940
And I would say those two achievements are kind of the things that had to be incrementally improved

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:39.180
to the point where you're, you're kind of just sort of getting, you're trying to realize

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:44.540
the ideal, you know, our codes are good at simulating ideals and we do a lot of work to try

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.640
to actually simulate the imperfections as well.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:46.960
Right.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.940
And, and, and capture as many of those imperfections as possible.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:54.680
But we've always been able to sort of do the ideal and say, yeah, the ideal works, you know,

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.480
the whole spherical cow idea.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:56.760
Right.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.860
It's exactly high around this ideal circle.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.420
And of course it's going to work like this.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.100
And there you go.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:03.680
Exactly.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.280
And it's like, oh, that works really well.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.620
And that's been the issue.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:12.460
And, and really what's happening is these large teams of, of, of experimentalists have been able

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:16.600
to make the laser better and continue to, and, and make these targets better.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:22.460
And, and they're actually getting closer and closer to ideals that even just a few years ago were like ridiculous.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:26.000
So it's, it's, it's really a testament to the, that hard work.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:26.260
Yeah.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.040
Really amazing.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:32.520
So what we're all learning is to collapse this balloon, you need 192 friends or 191 friends.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.100
If you don't count yourself, right?

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.880
Right.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:36.140
Right.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:40.260
The fact that we're doing a can, like this whole room is, is, is very important.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.020
And, you know, we're not actually shining the lasers on the capsule.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.860
That's something that's called direct drive.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:52.920
And indeed that is a, a field of study that provides its own challenge because indeed each laser is like a little fingertip trying to push on the capsule.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:59.240
This is so-called indirect drive because we're driving the capsule by the, the heating bath of the lasers.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.140
The lasers are heating this, this whole room and that's driving the capsule.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:12.840
So it's the actual, it's more of the shell that is playing the important role of, of doing the compression and you need to provide just enough controlled and even heating to make it go.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:13.300
Right.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:13.640
Yeah.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:18.240
You want to make that, but you still need to make that heating as controlled and even as you can.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:29.440
And it's still not even enough really when you, so there's been, you have to do a lot of work with, you know, making sure that heating, you know, where you put the beams, where the spots are, which are kind of like the elements in your oven.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:29.740
Right.

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:33.480
You know, if you turn on the broil elements, you'll burn your toast.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:33.780
Right.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:41.060
And so you have to know where to put those elements, where to, where do those spots hit the inside of the whole room to heat as uniformly as possible.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:41.380
Yeah.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.520
And people might be thinking, well, compressing something 30 times.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.880
It's, it's not that crazy.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.520
We do that with air all the time.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.920
You look at combustion engines and other stuff, but you're also heating it.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.800
Well, it's 30 times linearly.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.140
You're also heating it to the near the temperature of the sun.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.080
It wants to get a lot bigger really quickly.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.440
It doesn't want to even stay where it is.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:58.660
Right.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:25:59.700
Absolutely.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:00.220
Yes.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:04.680
You're heating it up to, to actually temperatures in excess of the center of the sun.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.420
And then, so, yeah, it doesn't want to be there.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.280
It wants to get moving.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:09.720
All right.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.420
Fantastic.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:14.460
Let's just talk one more science side thing, then we'll dive into the software side.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.600
This is the first time this has been done and it's a huge accomplishment.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:26.380
How do you all see this, this very quick and small reaction potentially turning into actual energy sources?

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.300
Where do we go from here to do something productive with this?

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:34.440
It's important to note that the National Ignition Facility itself is a demonstration facility.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.540
It's a research facility.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.740
So it's not meant to become an energy facility.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.200
And indeed, there are other startups out there.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:46.440
And I think there are probably going to be more that are exploring ways to commoditize this.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:51.120
So it's kind of interesting to kind of think about the energy a little bit if I can, you know.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:57.960
So just to kind of add a scale to this, you know, like a human eats about 2,000 calories of food a day, right?

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.000
An adult, right?

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.480
And those are actually kilocalories, nutritional calories.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:06.180
So that's 2 million calories, which is, you know, two mega calories.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:13.680
And it turns out that a calorie is kind of convenient is 4 joules, another scientific measure of energy that we use all the time.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:22.100
So that 2 kilocalories we eat every day is basically 2 million calories, which is 8 megajoules, 8 million joules.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.840
So just multiply by that 4.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.760
So 8 megajoules you eat every day, right?

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:32.980
So this laser is producing 2 megajoules, sort of like your breakfast, right, of energy.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:39.420
So it's actually not an achievable amount of energy, but it does it in just a few nanoseconds, right?

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:46.760
And I don't know how to describe a nanosecond all that well, except to know that, you know, that the speed of light is a good measure, right?

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.420
The speed of light.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:52.160
So, you know, at the speed of light, a light wave can go around the Earth 7.5 times in a second.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.860
But in a nanosecond, light only goes 30 centimeters.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.240
So about a foot.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.080
And so I think that gives you an idea of just how quick that is.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.720
And so that's the key.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.060
Yeah, it gives you a sense of how insane, how insanely precise those lasers have to be.

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:06.580
Exactly.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:07.400
Yeah.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.740
They've got that 30 centimeters.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:10.280
Right.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.520
The entire, yeah, that's the cosmic speed limit.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.640
No information can go faster than that.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.020
And so everything has to be within this really small envelope.

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:19.340
Okay.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.540
It's quite amazing.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:27.700
And so, and then the reason why we're talking about this particular achievement is that it actually yielded a little over 3 megajoules.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:31.140
So maybe, you know, breakfast plus lunch in fusion yield.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.440
And again, that happened, you know, instantaneously, effectively, that was released.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:39.380
So it's more about the release that makes it amazing.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:44.620
So, but the thing is that the energies aren't all that large at this point.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:50.840
And it occurred to me that, you know, well, if you think about, it's kind of interesting to think about, like, so going back to the food analogy.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.100
So you eat, make eight megajoules per day.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:56.940
A day is 24 hours times 60 minutes times 60 seconds.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.580
So 24 times 3600.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.980
It's 80 or 90,000 seconds.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:01.320
Right.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.080
So eight megajoules divided by say 80,000 seconds.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.860
That works out to 100 joules per second or 100 watts.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.120
So you as a human, you know, burn 100 watts.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:12.520
Right.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.700
Which is a very, we use that term all the time.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:15.900
Right.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:23.640
So, and you can kind of imagine taking a mannequin and putting a hundred watt incandescent bulb inside and it would kind of heat up to our skin temperatures.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:28.300
So we're going at a much, much higher wattage because we're doing it very quickly.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:36.600
But so you can actually sort of think of like, you know, a unit of measure that we often use in, you know, electricity and stuff is, you know, sort of the kilowatt hour.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:36.940
Right.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:40.480
A thousand watts times an hour, which is, again, just 3600.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.980
So a kilowatt hour is just 3.6 megajoules then.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.240
So 3600 times a thousand watts.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.240
So 3.6 megajoules is a kilowatt hour.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:55.360
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by User Interviews.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:00.980
As a developer, how often do you find yourself talking back to products and services that you use?

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:04.780
Sometimes it may be frustration over how it's working poorly.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.660
And if they just did such and such, it would work better.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.000
And it's easy to do.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.920
Other times it might be delight.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.120
Wow, they auto-filled that section for me.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.480
How did they even do that?

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:15.920
Wonderful.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.540
Thanks.

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:24.240
While this verbalization might be great to get the thoughts out of your head, did you know that you can earn money for your feedback on real products?

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.680
User Interviews connects researchers with professionals that want to participate in research studies.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:35.520
There is a high demand for developers to share their opinions on products being created for developers.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:40.120
Aside from the extra cash, you'll talk to people building products in your space.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:46.240
You will not only learn about new tools being created, but you'll also shape the future of the products that we all use.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:51.180
It's completely free to sign up and you can apply to your first study in under five minutes.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.500
The average study pays over $60.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:31:00.480
However, many studies specifically interested in developers pay several hundreds of dollars for a one-on-one interview.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.660
Are you ready to earn extra income from sharing your expert opinion?

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:09.620
Head over to talkpython.fm/userinterviews to participate today.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.920
The link is in your podcast player show notes.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.440
Thank you to User Interviews for supporting the show.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:22.600
And not to put you on the spot, Michael, but do you know how much you pay per kilowatt hour for your electricity in your home?

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.980
I think 17 cents.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.480
Oh, that's awesome.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.960
I'm so impressed.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.000
I'm pretty sure.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:28.580
I'm pretty sure.

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:29.800
As long as I have the units right.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.480
Yeah.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.620
No, that's about right.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.820
Since I have an electric car, I have little stuff that'll show me.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.940
Like, here's how much you charge and how much it pays.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.940
Enter your price here to get your...

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.580
So I'm pretty sure it's 17.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:42.880
It might have gone up just a tiny bit.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.220
Okay.

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:43.500
Yeah.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:49.160
So I pay about 25 off peak and like 45 cents per kilowatt hour on peak.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.600
And so I have an EV and, you know, I'm kind of aware of all that as well.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:32:00.220
But so again, you know, this shot produced about a little over three mega joules when a kilowatt hour is 3.6.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:00.540
Right.

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.880
Which is, as you said, you can buy one for 17 cents.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:08.820
So I can pretty much save with certainty that this experiment cost more than 17 cents.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:13.640
Even if you scale it up somewhat, it's going to be more than 17 cents.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:13.880
Yeah.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.180
Yeah.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:19.960
This one experiment for my one kilowatt hour I got out of, or a little less than a kilowatt hour I got out of it.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.500
And never mind that there was a certain amount put in.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:26.020
I had to put two mega joules in and there's inefficiencies as well.

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:30.260
So I think that just sort of outlines the challenge of scale.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:30.640
Right.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:36.780
I mean, so, you know, I have to make a capsule that's way, way cheaper than 17 cents to make money.

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:41.500
I have to, you know, probably I want to get more than a kilowatt hour per shot.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:45.060
I'll probably want a 10 or a hundred kilowatt hours per shot.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:52.660
And then I'm going to have to have a lot, a high rep rate because ultimately to power your home and my home and a town's home, you know, you need lots of kilowatt hours.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:55.100
And so, you know, scaling it up is a challenge.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:33:00.160
I think that's just sort of a nice way to illustrate, you know, where you have to go to get there.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:00.440
Yeah.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.620
You got to start somewhere, though.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.040
The first transistors, I'm sure, were expensive.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.040
You know, the first.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:05.720
Oh, exactly.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:09.380
100 kilobytes of hard drive storage seemed just insane.

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:12.200
If you told somebody, well, we're going to need a terabyte on everybody's computer.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.600
I go, no, we can't do that.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.300
Exactly.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:14.780
Yeah.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:15.940
Absolutely.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:16.520
Yeah.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.620
On an SD card.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:17.900
Nothing.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:18.220
Yeah.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:18.520
So.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.060
Exactly.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.040
There's a lot to do.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.880
There's a lot of growth there that needs to happen.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.160
It's early stage for sure.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.060
Right, right, right.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:25.380
Awesome.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.360
Well, let's talk about some of the software side.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:32.900
I know that you guys have over at the LLNL, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, you have

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:33.640
a software portal.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:38.000
We have a bunch of different applications and things that you're sharing, which are really

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:38.340
great.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.980
And so I know that you've got a lot of neat things happening on the software side.

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:46.320
Your area has been largely around designing and simulating the experiments.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.420
And then once someone runs them to go, okay, I got some data.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.040
How'd that work?

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:51.780
How do we adjust?

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:55.160
Maybe talk to us about some of the software side of what you're doing there.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.000
Yeah, right.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.060
Like we're saying, our kind of design cycle is that we have these quite impressive multi-physics

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.780
codes that can simulate these experiments, right?

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:10.740
that actually mock up the whole room and the capsule inside and actually fake lasers in

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:17.240
and run how they would interact with the gold atoms and actually run the entire simulation.

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:20.820
But, you know, you usually don't want to just push the button and just have it come out.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.160
Usually you're asking questions about it.

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.100
You're instrumenting it up, if you will.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.560
You're testing, you're checking things.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.040
So you're kind of steering these simulations.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:34.360
And so one of the big facets of software that we've been working on for the last few years

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.000
is to improve that steering in Python.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.460
We can talk a little bit more about that.

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:42.820
But then also we have, so then you get out your simulations result, right?

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.300
You say, oh, well, this result did such and such, right?

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.200
But now you want to actually compare it to data.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:51.540
So you have to go over to a web page or talk to somebody who ran an experiment on NIF

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.980
and talk to them and get that data.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:57.580
So that's another area that we've been working really hard on over the last five or six years.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:01.740
I've been to try to improve that ability test so that basically we're kind of bringing all

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:07.300
the parties together so that making the simulations easier to run, easier to work with, and also

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:12.700
having the data and tools proximate to that so that we can all sit in one place and actually

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:16.140
ask all the questions and get all the answers in that one spot.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.160
So historically, that's kind of been the design cycle.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.980
And it's been fairly organic, right?

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:27.160
Where people will write tools that work for them to steer code or to do some post-processing

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:31.500
and then they'll share them with people and then somebody else will share it and they'll

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:37.320
tweak it and eventually somebody will quit asking just friends and they'll put it in a directory

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.440
somewhere, make it readable, right?

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:46.560
So that had been the way we'd done business for a while and we're trying to actually improve

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:46.880
that.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:52.080
So about five or six years ago, I was designing some experiments for the NIF and I was running

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:56.020
one of these tools that were sort of an organically grown thing and I was trying to do something

00:35:56.020 --> 00:36:00.060
that was a little bit challenging for it and a little bit out of its strengths.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.200
And I basically kind of had an existential crisis.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.120
I just thought, I can't do this anymore.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.160
These tools aren't cutting it.

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:12.220
The code underneath is great, but I'm just beating my head against the wall to talk to

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:13.440
it and to get things out of it.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:17.680
And you can really burn a lot of human time doing that, which is very expensive.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.580
And so I basically just stopped running those tools.

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:25.820
Like it was just, you know, kind of like the whole office space thing, you know, where the

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.660
guy post-technotic suggestion, right?

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:27.920
Yeah.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.180
I just thought, you know.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:31.820
I don't think I want to go to work today.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.740
I don't think I want to do that either.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.880
Like just, I was just kind of done.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.580
Right?

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:38.120
I don't know.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.640
It was kind of like that.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.340
Mental model.

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.460
Right.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.940
It was kind of like that.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.400
I just felt like I can't do that anymore.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:50.520
And I think my time would be better spent trying to improve the model, improve the ecosystem.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:55.600
And again, so I am drinking Python Kool-Aid all the time, learning more and more about the

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.200
ecosystem.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:01.180
Also learning just about, you know, Git and continuous integration, just things that are

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:06.180
out there that I'd been entirely naive about myself and realizing that, oh, you know, there's

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.060
actually things to do.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:11.100
And in all fairness, of course, other people are thinking things like this as well.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.060
As per the page you've got up here, you know, the lab has tons of people who are doing

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.420
this stuff in spades.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:23.100
But in our little corner of ignition land, that wasn't happening as much as I wanted.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:27.660
And so I basically looked around and I found a couple things that other people had just

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.300
been starting.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:33.320
And one of them is basically a Python wrapper of one of our codes.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.320
We have one of our multi-physics codes.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.140
We call it Hydra.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:41.820
And the developer physicist Joe Koenig did the hard work of actually installing Python

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.000
and a Python interpreter into that.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.640
So it actually talks to this big multi-physics parallel code.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.000
Interesting.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.320
So it's actually hosting the Python runtime, not the other way around, where Python is trying

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.760
to wrap it C API?

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:55.520
Right, right.

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:55.860
No, no.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:38:00.780
The code itself is running and Python is just bolted on top of it.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:05.160
And so, yeah, so the code is still in control.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.700
It's actually very challenging.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.720
And Joe did a great job of doing that after the fact.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:14.880
But now you have the ability to actually, you know, to initialize the problem until it's

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.820
run state purely in Python.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.580
And he was starting to build an infrastructure to develop our problems, our ignition problems,

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.120
these whole arms and capsules and such.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.980
And I just jumped in on that.

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.740
I thought, this is what we have to do.

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:31.180
It was a tremendous amount of effort to build that up to make it something that actually worked.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:37.260
But I think that it's actually one of the easier tools out there, most robust and user-friendly

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.320
tools we have now.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:44.040
And so that's sort of the one half of the puzzle is just making a Python interface, a purely

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.540
Python interface to run these tools.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:51.380
And again, so this tool we call HyPyde for the Hydra Python deck.

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.980
And again, Joe Koenig initiated it and I've been really involved.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.860
And Chris Young has gotten involved since then helping a lot.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:03.080
And so we basically just tried to build the entire ecosystem of how do you initially initialize

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:07.200
the horum and the capsule and the laser and all of those things so that you can tell this

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.080
Hydra code to run and give you some results, right?

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.880
That's been a big push that I've been, you know, championing and proselytizing on.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.660
The other half of it, and this kind of goes back to Dave Monroe and Yorick, like I was

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.620
mentioning earlier, a lot of people use Yorick.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.160
It's a very, very useful tool for data analysis.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:29.940
It's again, it's an interactive tool with a very, very nice array syntax.

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:35.140
It's a think of it kind of like interpreted C if C was, you know, C syntax was just interpreted

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.920
with a really nice array syntax built on.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:42.520
So it's still, it's still quite widely used, but I think to Dave's credit, Dave Monroe's

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:47.320
credit, as he was near retirement a couple of years ago, he decided that Python was the

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:47.820
way to go.

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:53.020
He decided that the future was going with the leveraging what's out there and just going

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:53.560
with Python.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.940
When you're the one who created your thing and you're like, you know what?

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.600
I love my baby, but it's time to think beyond.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.100
Absolutely.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.280
I don't think he gets enough credit for that.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.740
I have immense respect for that because, I mean, I don't know if I would do that.

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:11.980
We, you know, a lot of people become very protective of their, of their, of their babies.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:12.280
Right.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.840
But no, he, you know, it's what's best.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.100
Right.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:19.360
And so to, before he, you know, the thing that's nice of one of the nice things about

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.260
Yorick is a lot like, you know, MATLAB or Mathematica, when you type Yorick and open

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.940
a shell, a shell, it's everything you get is right there.

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:26.220
Right.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.680
It's a, it's, it's a single environment.

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:32.280
And, and, you know, like internet, Python is a little more heterogeneous and diverse than

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:32.500
that.

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:32.760
Right.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.820
And, it's a feature in a bug.

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:39.880
So one of the things he wanted to do was to, as sort of a parting gift to us is he created

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:45.020
this tool called iDesign that is basically at its core, it's a Python virtual environment

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:49.340
that just pip installs all of the packages that we like to do.

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:54.360
That's a lot of them that we've been building, you know, to create this Python ecosystem that

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:58.700
will then talk to this Hypoid Hydra, you know, simulation layer.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:04.300
And, and, and basically then everybody can just type Python and they'll get that environment.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:08.500
And, you know, that's, yeah, that by itself, that's not all that big a deal, but it does

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:12.520
actually have a certain amount of nice features that we've been able to build it into the,

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.100
the, our GitLab continuous integration environment.

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:18.720
We built an awful lot on it since, since he did, he did retire.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:23.980
And, you know, you can take snapshots of those environment state and some other things.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:28.740
So people have told us we need to open source that I've sort of balked at it, but I think

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:31.080
I've made that the decision that we're going to.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.360
So iDesign will eventually be on that page you were showing earlier.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.380
So, you know, hopefully in a year or whatever, we're going to do that.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:41.840
But another key component, I think one of the things I get excited about, and it's one of

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.360
the things that's exciting about Python in general is the fact that, you know, that you can have

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.700
these, it's an enabling technology, right?

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:53.060
And so now that you have an iDesign environment, everybody can come into a uniform Python environment

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:56.100
and everybody speaks the same languages, has the same tools at their disposal.

00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:02.060
Well, now you can actually build in tools to go grab data from the NIF databases, right?

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:05.220
This, where they're running shots and they're compiling all of this data.

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:11.000
It's not always as easily accessible as, as you would like for, for, you know, maybe a non-expert

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.520
in that particular, you know, diagnostic or whatever.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:18.300
And so what we've been doing at another big campaign that a part of this iDesign ecosystem

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.100
is that we've been building what's called a shot data pipeline.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.240
And again, this runs in the GitLab continuous integration environment.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:29.120
Every night we go off to a bunch of databases and just harvest a whole bunch of data, bring

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:34.340
it in and rebuild this iDesign environment with physical data, again, the tools, and then

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:37.200
the ability to actually run the code all in Python, right?

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.420
All in one environment.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:42.580
Yeah, probably before when people would run the experiments, I don't know what before is

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:46.320
maybe way far back, but when you get started, you know, you're like, okay, I got to get the

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.100
data here and then we got to maybe process it and then convert it to this other form and

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.260
then filter this down.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:54.860
And then finally we can get it so we can import it over here and process it, right?

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:58.760
And so you're talking about, well, what if you had a CI pipeline that could do a bunch of

00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:59.880
these sort of steps, right?

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:00.640
Is that the idea?

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:05.620
Basically, so experimental physicists who know their diagnostics extremely well.

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:09.880
And so they actually will take that raw data and distill it to something useful.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:16.780
We're really just doing the more prosaic step of going and getting it and bringing it so

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.400
that it's proximate to the designer.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:22.680
And, you know, that's one of those things that's like, well, yeah, right?

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.400
Just go get it.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.700
But it's a huge task and it wastes an awful lot of designer time when you have to chase

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.060
down data for shots.

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.580
And so this is something that we're actually, it's not a lot of data really, but it's, but

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:37.140
per shot, you might, you might only be dealing with, you might even only be dealing with a few

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:38.600
numbers, few scalars, right?

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:42.220
And then it can go up to images and it can go up, you can ask for a lot of, you know,

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:46.520
you can get more detailed pictures, but even you might just be looking for, for just a few

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:46.900
numbers.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:51.400
But, but the thing is, if you have to go ask for those few numbers every time, it's not

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.300
like it always has to happen.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:56.400
It just, there wasn't a process in place to just sort of try to, that was sort of the

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:56.980
culture, right?

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:59.020
When you want something, you just go ask somebody, right?

00:43:59.020 --> 00:43:59.900
That's fine.

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:03.940
But we've been trying to, trying to make the culture a little bit more like let's provide

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:06.260
it and let's, let's automatically create it.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:10.980
And I think that's been really an exciting, then this whole Python framework has been the

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:14.040
enabling technology to make, allow that to happen.

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:18.640
And we're just at the point now over the last year or so that in fact, a lot of this stuff

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.740
is still coming to fruition right now.

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:25.520
You'd still consider it alpha and beta, but it's, it's actually, it's finally coming together,

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.580
which I think is really exciting.

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:31.220
And, and they know that, that starts maybe kind of slowly changing the culture, right?

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.920
Where people start expecting, Hey, it's actually for easy for me.

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:39.540
If I just put my data in a spot and, and those shot data pipeline guys, we're going to just

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:40.760
going to harvest it every night.

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.840
And we'll just, I don't have to worry about it.

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.180
I don't have to feel email.

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:49.980
Once the few, the foundation of the automation is there and people start to realize they can

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:50.480
trust it.

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:54.200
Then, then you start to get creative and put more things on there and leverage it more.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.920
And it just makes a lot of, it's PyPI, right?

00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:58.640
It's small.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.320
It is.

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:00.800
It is.

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:05.000
And another part of that is that the design community, which again, I talked about how

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.460
a lot of things tool people will develop tools and then they'll just share them when they

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.480
ask, maybe put it in a directory somewhere.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:16.120
Well, now we have a place where you can actually have your own repository and, and maybe a physicist

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:20.260
isn't all that interested in learning what a Git repository is, but we can help with that.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:20.740
You know what I mean?

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:24.120
And, you know, it can become a place where you can have your tools and they're available

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:28.340
and they're deployed because we also have the issue that we have systems that are air

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:28.620
gap.

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.740
Right.

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:35.160
And so we need to have this whole distribution mirrored over here with a physical pass off.

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:35.160
Right.

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:39.080
And so we try to do that now regularly rather than just piecemeal.

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:43.580
And, you know, hey, if you create a little tool or whatever, whatever it is, it's just

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:44.860
everywhere all of a sudden.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:45.160
Right.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.500
And that's really new.

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:50.360
And I think that's, again, very empowering for the designers who are creating these new

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:50.820
experiments.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:55.760
I think people who haven't experienced it, these organizations, these research labs and

00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:00.960
other similar places, they basically become software companies.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.160
At least they have a software team that is functioning really at a pretty high level.

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:10.460
And I worked at a research place that had six or seven PhDs and a bunch of grad students and

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.380
me and another software developer.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:17.420
And we were writing software full time and it just it kept getting better and better.

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:22.460
And what actually the grad students would say to me is, if you keep doing this, we're going

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:23.180
to be out of a job.

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.240
All the software you're writing, this is what we do.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:29.420
And like, no, what you're going to do is you're going to do actual science and actually better

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:30.060
stuff.

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:33.460
And every time they'd be like, well, this was my job and here it is a button now.

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:35.760
And nobody was fired from that.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:39.220
They just did more interesting stuff and took on more ambitious projects.

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:41.180
It was it's pretty cool to see.

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:41.960
Exactly.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:44.200
And I've been accused of that before.

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:45.740
Like, you're going to put us all out of a job.

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:49.960
And it's like, no, no, your job is so much more interesting now.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.440
And my job is more interesting.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:54.420
I mean, you know, I spend a lot of time developing now.

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:59.720
I've kind of made this my passion and I have a smaller fraction of my time doing designing

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.600
experiments, not zero, but smaller.

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:05.740
But I actually feel like it's much, much more efficient than it ever was.

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:06.060
Yeah.

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:09.080
You might have a bigger impact, though, even though it's less time.

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.520
Yeah, it's just a lot more.

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:11.320
Yeah, exactly.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:12.440
It's just a lot more efficient.

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:17.020
And it's fun to show, you know, younger people who are coming in, you know, how to how to

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:22.400
do this and, you know, that it doesn't have to kind of be sort of a what I consider a painful

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:22.840
cycle.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.360
I mean, you know, maybe maybe some people enjoy it.

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:25.760
Yeah.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:30.560
So I like to say that I feel like I'm, you know, building the tools that I wish I had when

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.380
I started.

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.640
I think I can, you know, it's it's happening, you know.

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:39.260
And again, we have a really, you know, I have a great team of folks that we're working with.

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:44.220
I work with, you know, computer scientists, Ryan Tran and Jimmy Smith helped me build this

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:44.680
stuff out.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.140
And it's just been it's been really great.

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:47.820
Sounds fantastic.

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.060
How many people are on the team?

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:53.500
So it's just a small and a certain amount of it is, you know, people who who want to help.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:58.580
So it's just a few of us, you know, again, Joe Coding and Chris Young and Dave Strozzi and

00:47:58.580 --> 00:47:59.040
such.

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:04.220
So and again, but then there are a lot of people who are starting to become contributors.

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:06.620
That's where the leverage starts.

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:08.520
Sort of a stone soup thing.

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.080
Yeah.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:09.700
Yeah.

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.840
And on the NIF more broadly, how many people are involved?

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.640
Oh, NIF?

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:14.540
Hundreds.

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:19.980
Jeremy on the on the call here might be able to give an actual number, but it's hundreds of

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:20.640
scientists.

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.640
And so, you know, for scale, you have to keep in mind that the Lawrence Livermore lab

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:25.900
has thousands of scientists.

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:32.340
So even though the NIF is a big program, it's actually fairly small as a part of the greater

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:33.260
lab portfolio.

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:37.480
I guess I want to emphasize that I'm speaking kind of for the design corner.

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:41.440
There's the experimental corner, the people who actually work with the hardware of the NIF

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:41.880
and stuff.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:46.000
And we talk to them, particularly with vis-a-vis the Shot Data Pipeline.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.560
There are a lot of places that have their own architectures.

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.760
You can see that with the open source page and stuff.

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:52.760
So there's a tremendous amount.

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:56.540
And a lot of those things are doing, you know, really great, their own great infrastructures.

00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:01.360
But this is really speaking towards the needs of the NIF ignition community.

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:08.720
You talked about the specific libraries that you are really focused on the work there,

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:14.180
but I'm sure you used a bunch of standard Python libraries, packages that people are familiar

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:14.400
with.

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:19.460
Maybe give us a sense of some of the tools and things that were at play that you're taking

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:19.980
advantage of.

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:20.420
Oh, yeah.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.880
Well, you know, of course, we're using all the numpy scipy stuff.

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.140
That's sort of a given.

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:31.120
And we also, and I design will bring, you know, we have, you know, PlasmaPy and X-Ray

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:37.940
DB and some of these, again, these really nice physical data packages that people have developed

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:41.700
in the open source community that now we just sort of bring in so that it's always there

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:43.940
and maintained for designers at your fingertips.

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:45.620
Certain number of us also do.

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:46.640
Yeah, there you go.

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.420
The page there you brought up.

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.820
Pip install PlasmaPy.

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.180
Or comments, all we prefer.

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:53.360
There you go.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:53.600
Yeah.

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:58.000
And, you know, a lot of us, including myself, are getting involved in, you know, machine

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:58.660
learning as well.

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:03.600
Of course, that's an important part of the emerging, you know, technology people are excited

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.660
to take advantage of.

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:10.380
And so, like, I install PyTorch into iDesign and try to make sure that's, which is a bit

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:11.040
of a challenge, right?

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:16.080
Because we have a really large, different architectures, you know, and taking advantage of their different

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:16.720
GPUs.

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.680
You have to, you know, it's not necessarily just a pip install.

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:20.940
You might have to compile it.

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:23.020
And so there are challenges there.

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:27.720
But we try to, you know, just make that available for the, you know, design community, which is

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:28.280
cool.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:32.620
Because again, I mean, not to harp on the enabling technology thing, but, you know, we can now,

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:38.160
and, you know, I do, again, as a research thing, you know, I can import PyTorch into my

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:44.800
HyPi, you know, that runs my big Hydra multi-physics simulation and have it do inference on some

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.100
part of the, you know, simulation, right?

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:49.400
And maybe, you know, even offload part of that.

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:53.600
And so there have been other, there are other efforts at the lab as looking at those kinds

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.440
of things as well.

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:58.080
But again, I don't know how you would do that without these tools that we've been building,

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.680
frankly, at least in our corner of the world.

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:04.980
Yeah, you got to keep building that foundation until everything is ready to click it together.

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:05.440
Yeah.

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.380
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:12.920
While it's as, while it's fun to imagine what would happen if you ask ChatGPT to, you know,

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:16.980
say, imagine ChatGPT, you had the most precise lasers in the world.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:19.520
How would you design a fusion experiment?

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.660
I'm sure that's not going to result in much.

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:27.660
Where do you actually see like real constructive AI applied to this and machine learning?

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:30.420
Do you have anything that you see on the radar there?

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:33.760
There are several things that are being, that it's being applied to.

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:38.180
And, and, and in fact, there are, you know, maybe there can be, you can find some links

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:43.160
here that there have been some, there's a group that sort of predicted, there were, there gave

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.300
some confidence whether this shot was going to achieve ignition, right?

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:51.860
Where they're trying to learn from the experience of past shots and try to get some idea of predicting

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:54.600
whether how a future shot will, will perform.

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.280
Those are, you know, new things that are, that are happening.

00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:01.960
Sort of, I think the, the two sides of it are, are probably those kinds of, those kinds of

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:05.540
high level things where you're trying to ask it, you know, big questions about, you know,

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.140
what would happen if I do this?

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:12.400
But there's, there's the other level of, of kind of using it to offload some of the big

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.640
numerical heavy lifting that we do all the time.

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:19.520
We run a lot of, you know, these simulations run massive calculations trying to, you know,

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:23.100
do the physics of these lasers shining into these, these whole rooms and such.

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:28.440
And some of those calculations could be learned by an inference engine and just maybe a simplified

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:31.120
version provided over and over, right?

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:36.660
And so there are several efforts being applied to that where, and basically training an agent

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:41.480
to just learn some part of, of how the simulation, you know, what the physical data the simulation

00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:42.200
should provide.

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.780
I've worked on some of those things.

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:45.460
There's more of that going on.

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:47.180
There's more details to that as well.

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:50.900
I mean, the way we do our simulations, right, we divide, you know, you can sort of think

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:54.440
of our simulations or multi-physics simulations, like, you know, like an image, right?

00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:58.720
An image divides, to make an image, you divide, divide it up into a whole bunch of little tiny

00:52:58.720 --> 00:52:59.340
pixels, right?

00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:02.080
And each pixel has a red, green, blue value.

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:03.140
And that's what makes your image.

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:05.680
And we kind of do that with our, our simulations.

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:09.820
If you want to simulate a whole room with a capsule inside, you basically divide it up into

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:11.400
a whole bunch of little tiny pixels.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
We call them nodes and we interconnect them with their nearest neighbors.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.320
So they create that links into a mesh.

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:21.700
And rather than having red, green, blue, we have physics attributes.

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.420
We tell it what it's made of.

00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:26.720
That node is what it's made of, how hot it is, you know, things like that.

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:27.980
It's ionization state.

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:31.720
And then we run the laws of physics on all of these nodes as they talk to each other.

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:33.720
And then they, then that unfolds.

00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:37.920
And so, but as you can imagine, if you have sort of a mesh of all these nodes, they can tangle

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.920
up and they can get all, all messed up.

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:44.200
And so one of the things that we do is we have, you know, a certain amount of algorithms

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:49.400
to try to keep that, that tangling from happening too much and crashing simulations.

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:54.900
So that's sort of an inside baseball thing, but that's one of the things that I'm, I'm one

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:59.260
of side projects I have, for instance, of, of actually using reinforcement learning to try

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:04.560
to figure out just by giving it a whole bunch of trials, you know, what's the best policy

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:09.140
for relaxing these, these nodes so that they don't crash a simulation.

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:12.680
These things just make simulations easier again, right?

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:17.620
And all of this, so you can ask, ask questions and explore more quickly and easily.

00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:18.000
Right.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:24.000
We all know how tricky even three body problems are in an orbiting system where they can become

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:24.520
chaotic.

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:31.620
And well, imagine, imagine this thing you're describing is the interactions are insane, right?

00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:36.200
And so if you could get something to predict, you just say, here's, here's a million different

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:40.060
examples of what happened, how it started, how it started, how's it going?

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:41.300
Sort of examples.

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:41.940
Right, exactly.

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:43.940
You got it, you got it.

00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:47.200
It started, we're thinking here, how's it going to go, right?

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.300
Right, right.

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.800
And of course, that's an experience in itself, right?

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:54.980
I mean, to actually take these forays into data science and large scale data sets and, you

00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:57.840
know, training in multiple GPUs and stuff like that.

00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:59.040
It's, it's been, been fun.

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:02.800
I mean, you know, I know people do that all the time, but it's, it's, it's interesting to

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:03.460
have that experience.

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:04.140
Yeah, for sure.

00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:09.880
There are some interesting articles of actually the CogSim team at LL&L and some of the work

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:10.400
being done there.

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.100
So I'll link, I'll link to those articles in the show notes.

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:13.960
People can check that out.

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:18.580
That is the team I'm kind of referring to that there is this effort to bring machine learning

00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:20.700
to bear on, on some of these problems.

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:22.900
And so that's good work that they're doing.

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:23.680
Yeah, of course.

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:28.860
We're getting short on time here, but let's wrap this up with one other aspect.

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:34.000
You talked about having air-gapped systems and, you know, not everything necessarily should

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.560
be online or is online.

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:38.200
You want it to be all kind of isolated and stable.

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:42.020
So you've got a lot of computation you got to be doing.

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:44.660
Tell us just a bit about the computing environment.

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:50.820
You have like interesting clusters or, or grid computing or what's the story for actually

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:51.620
running all this stuff?

00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:52.200
Yeah, yeah.

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.140
Good, good question.

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:53.400
Yeah.

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:55.140
There's for the context.

00:55:55.140 --> 00:56:00.500
So, so basically we have a bunch of very, very large computer clusters at the lab and some

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:05.440
of them, you know, are like near the biggest computers in the world or, or were at one time

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:05.780
and such.

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:10.320
I don't, I don't keep track of that, but those are all on lists and there are new ones on the,

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:13.020
on the horizon that will take that crown again.

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:19.100
What we do is basically submit our jobs, carving out some chunk of the machine to run, to run these,

00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:22.580
these multi-physics simulations for so many hours or days.

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:26.400
And so we're doing that, you know, we do a certain amount of that on the, on the open

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:30.300
side, but then we also, we have a lot of resources on these air gap systems.

00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:32.140
We do a lot of our running there.

00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:37.500
That's sort of the exigency of moving our data, physical data from the NIF and our tools

00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:38.120
over there.

00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.940
So we always have up-to-date tools to run there.

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:42.540
These are made by different vendors.

00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:43.500
It's interesting.

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:47.000
They're evolving where they're, you know, there's larger GPU components than there used

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:47.380
to be.

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:50.360
And the codes are having, are learning to adapt to that.

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:52.260
So it's, it's a fairly dynamic environment.

00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:57.980
That's kind of the, I guess the, the general run environment we have that we're, we're running

00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:00.000
on a, on a bunch of clusters.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.620
How's quantum computing looking?

00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:06.040
Are there any quantum applicable problems here?

00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:08.220
Not directly from my experience.

00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:12.020
I know there are some people working on quantum computing at the lab closely attached to that.

00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:17.700
So I, yeah, I'm more, I'm specifically thinking like if you had a quantum computer, would

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:22.540
this allow, not necessarily trying to invent quantum computing, but somebody happens to.

00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:23.480
Probably not.

00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:26.840
I mean, I, I, maybe somebody, somebody else would know something about it.

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:27.020
Yeah.

00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:31.360
I mean, really we're just trying to kind of, you know, integrate these differential equations

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.640
that describe the physical system.

00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:37.360
And, you know, maybe there's a way to diagonalize a matrix with quantum computing.

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:41.980
That's way, way better than, than an explicit method, you know, that we, we use.

00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:44.020
But yeah, I'm not, I'm not aware of it.

00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:44.800
Yeah.

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.320
At this point, I definitely don't know enough about quantum computing.

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:49.540
Even suggest that.

00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:51.380
I have an opinion on this, but.

00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:52.620
Well, I guess we're due now.

00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:55.260
If we, if these, these barriers are falling, right?

00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:55.500
Yeah.

00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:56.100
That's right.

00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:57.080
Where's the trifecta?

00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:57.660
Come on.

00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:58.220
Yeah, exactly.

00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:02.260
We're trying to figure it of new things.

00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:04.660
Be careful what you wish for though.

00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:04.880
Right.

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:08.240
I mean, having been able to crack any password, I don't know if that's a good thing.

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:08.880
Exactly.

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.320
I'd love faster computers.

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.760
Wait, baking doesn't work anymore.

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:12.260
Oh no.

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:12.760
Right.

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:18.180
Back to rubbing sticks together and sleeping on the wood.

00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:18.620
Exactly.

00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:22.900
I've got my money clip that I keep everything on my person.

00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.460
Exactly.

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:27.980
I'll, I'll mail you some cash in, in physical mail.

00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:28.580
Get this.

00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:28.900
Right.

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:29.120
Right.

00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:29.800
You're right.

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.740
Careful what we wish for.

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:35.260
And we won't have that much cash because chat GDP will be writing our software that we used

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:35.600
to write.

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:36.540
So it'll be tough.

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:37.440
Well, this is true.

00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:38.140
This is true.

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:43.400
No, honestly, I'm, I'm very optimistic about the future and a lot of these things and especially

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:43.760
this.

00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.180
So awesome work.

00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:48.000
Now, before you get out of here, let me ask you the final two questions.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.700
If you're going to work on some of these Python projects, what editor are you using?

00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:54.540
I've kind of gone through the litany of editors in my evolution.

00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:58.700
I started with VI and went to Emacs, went and used Emacs for a very long time.

00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:02.040
And then probably five or so years ago, I decided I need to make a change.

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:06.340
And I, I went to Adam and, you know, I could use Emacs binding.

00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:11.580
So I didn't have to rewire my muscle memory and really enjoyed that until of course, last

00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:13.120
summer when they, they killed it.

00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:17.180
And so I had to look around and it was funny because I had a summer student who I had just

00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:18.360
told how to use Adam.

00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:19.560
And I was like, oh, this is great.

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:22.800
And then I had to tell him like literally a week later, forget that.

00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:25.320
You know, that thing you really love, they, they canceled it.

00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:25.740
I'm sorry.

00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:26.180
Yeah.

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.500
Just don't, just don't.

00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:28.780
He was like, and he liked it too.

00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:32.660
I looked around and I think I did what a lot of people are doing.

00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:35.440
I went with, VS Code and I love it.

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:35.880
My goodness.

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.740
It's really mature and good.

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:42.800
And, you know, co-pilot it's, it's again, you know, it's, I'm still, you know, learning

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:45.480
how to use it effectively, but, it's amazing.

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:46.300
It's a state changer.

00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:47.640
It is absolutely amazing.

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:49.400
Because we are working on clusters.

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:50.380
A lot of things are remote.

00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:55.380
You know, the, the fact that you can do remote SSH, you know, and you can have your, your software

00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:58.660
here and your notebook here and then a terminal below it.

00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:01.000
And it's all just in your VS Code window.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.460
It's, it's pretty sweet.

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:02.940
Yeah.

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:03.200
Yeah.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.600
You kind of connect to have your, your editor running locally, but connected.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.260
Right.

01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:12.400
There's no delay with typing and all, but, but you are running on a, on the heavy iron

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.740
somewhere, the big iron somewhere.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.180
Indeed.

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:19.720
I feel like a VS Code is maybe the natural successor to people who did Sublime and, and Adam.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.540
Those are, those are the, I see that kind of that, that flow there.

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:23.080
All right.

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.200
And then a notable PI PI package.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:29.820
You right off the bat, you put up at the beginning, you know, LL and L dot GitHub dot IO

01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:35.080
is, is I think, you know, a really good resource for just sort of seeing the, open source

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.740
packages that are being developed at the lab.

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:41.240
And again, they have a bent towards high performance computing and such.

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.720
And like I said, eventually I design I'll be up there.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.180
We'll, we'll open source that.

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:49.760
I will mention that one that, Dave Monroe again, and is sort of trying to, you know,

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.560
take care of us before he retired.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:56.400
He wrote a nice little package called QND, which is on this for quick and dirty QND.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.760
And that's now being, maintained by Dave Strozzi.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:04.540
And, it's a nice little package, but what it does is actually unifies an interface

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:10.480
for several different binary formats, in particular HDF five and at CDF and a lab internal

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.660
format called PDB.

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:16.120
And, it's one of those things that passes the test in my mind where I've actually reached

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:20.860
for it in my own, just little projects where if I need to just store some data, right.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:25.200
Numpy has, has, has its own storage thing, but it doesn't do really good.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.840
If you, if you, you know, have a hierarchical data or if you want to do records, you know,

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:34.200
and have things, you know, stored over time, but this is actually a simple enough and uniform

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.000
enough interface that it's, it's, I, I, it's like, wow, this really works.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.520
And so anytime you actually reach for it, when you just need that tool, I think that, you know,

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:45.380
it's past sort of some sort of threshold of usability.

01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:46.880
And again, it's open source.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:51.280
And I think, you know, for people who do things like that, you know, work with binary data,

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:54.280
I think this might be something that, you know, other people might want to look at.

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:55.660
One of those Lego building blocks.

01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:56.600
Yeah, exactly.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:01.440
One other, one other question, you know, people out there who are really interested in what

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:06.680
you're talking about and maybe they previously thought of LL and L as just a place for physicists.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:10.900
And maybe you're starting to think, oh, maybe it's a place for software people and data scientists.

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:12.460
Are you guys hiring?

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:13.860
We are actually.

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:14.720
A lot of opportunity for folks.

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.220
Absolutely.

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:21.540
Actually right now, strangely, you know, I think there might be some tailwinds after this success.

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:25.740
That's above my pay grade, but I think that, you know, there's something that should be

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:25.980
happening.

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:28.020
There should be a lot more good stuff going on.

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:30.780
But right now, even there's a lot of hiring going on.

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:36.440
And so if you find some of this, you know, interesting Python chops, you know, check us out.

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:36.980
Definitely.

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:38.520
Jay, thanks for being here.

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.100
Congratulations once again.

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:41.600
That's really amazing work.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:44.820
And I know it's, I know it's early days, but we'll look back on it, I'm sure.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:45.240
Yeah.

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:45.940
Thank you, Michael.

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:46.180
Yeah.

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:47.560
It's been a lot of fun.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.220
It's fun to be a part of it and look back on the, on the road.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.860
It's still a long road ahead.

01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:53.960
It is, but it's, I'll be tracking it.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.300
It'll be exciting to see where it goes.

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:55.720
Thanks.

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:59.980
