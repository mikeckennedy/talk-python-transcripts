00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.820
Space science is one of the few sciences that can spark wonder and imagining in almost anyone.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.420
It also happens to be the domain of Python, with many missions, telescopes, and analysis

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.180
happening with Python playing a major role.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.860
On this episode, we have Thomas Alvin, who has worked on several recent space missions.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.600
He's also created a delightful YouTube channel called Space Science with Python.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.000
It's approachable and yet concrete and realistic.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.360
We're going to dive into some of his videos and see how Python can model things like asteroid flybys and render comets in 3D.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.540

Thomas, welcome to talkpython.fm.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.880
Thanks for inviting me, Michael.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.040
I'm looking forward to this conversation here today and spread astronomy and Python a little bit around.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.260
Ah, two things that are so amazing.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.220
Obviously, people know that I love Python, but I really love maybe three angles here.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.200
I love astronomy and I just love how it allows us to just dream so big, right?

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.420
And so much of science fiction is about space and interplanetary travel.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.920
And I mean, obviously, we're not there, but thinking about space is just so amazing.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.760
And also, all of your work on YouTube is really nice.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.180
And we're going to talk a little bit about that.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.240
So, super exciting topics that we got lined up here.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.660
Yeah, thank you very much.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.540
Indeed, space is really also one of my passions since I'm a child, right?

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.180
So, I worked on some stuff, still doing this as a hobby, as a side project, as a freelancer and so on.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.720
So, I think we have some topics to talk in the next 60 minutes or so.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.380
Yes, we do.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.220
So, before we get into that, though, let's just set the stage with a little bit of background for yourself.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.080
And what's your story?

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.680
How did you get into programming in Python?

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.260
And how do you find yourself doing all these live stream Python space science stuff on YouTube?

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.960
Yeah, sure.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.860
So, as I just said, astronomy is part of my passion since I'm a kid, right?

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.120
But it's more about Python.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.140
And back in 2009, I started studying physics.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.200
And then I did my bachelor thesis in 2012 at the European Space Agency in Nordvalk in the Netherlands.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:53.040
And I had the task to create some kind of simulation software to determine the detectability of so-called near-Earth objects.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.540
So, objects that are, let's say, coming sometimes quite close to Earth.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.480
And you want to observe them.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.320
You want to detect them.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.160
You have your telescopes.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.760
But you don't want to waste resources.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.180
You want to see, where do I have to look with what kind of settings?

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.680
So, this was my very first project and also my very first touching point or contact point with Python.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:22.020
Afterwards, I did my master thesis in Göttingen, so in the middle of Germany, where I was also a student at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.720
And there I was part for three years, a little bit more than three years, on the Fiele mission.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.760
So, part of the Rosetta mission, which flew to the comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.080
So, maybe some of the listeners know this ESA mission that was landing on the comet.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:45.700
And there I was part of a small instrument called the Dust Impact Monitor, where we used Python for data analytics and so on.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.620
So, if you read a paper about this mission from 2014 or so, Python is involved.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.460
You can believe me that.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:59.280
Afterwards, PhD, I was part of the Cassini mission of the so-called Cosmic Dust Analyzer.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.500
You see asteroids, dust, you know.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.080
The cosmos is big, but I was always interested in the small stuff.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.020
And there I used Python for numerical simulations and also machine learning.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.520
And this machine learning task is something that I'm still continuing because since three years I left academia.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.700
I joined the automotive industry here in Stuttgart.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.940
There are only two candidates and it's one of them.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.380
It's Mercedes-Benz, where I work as a senior machine learning engineer.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.740
But in my free time, I'm still doing these tutorial videos to share my knowledge.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.640
I gathered over the last couple of years and I'm doing also freelance work at the Free University of Berlin,

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.640
continuing to develop some machine learning models for the Cassini mission.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.100
Yeah.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.320
So, this is my short story.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.700
What a cool story.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:53.440
I mean, you got to be on not just one, but two space missions, which is really, really fascinating.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.020
Yeah.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.820
So, people work on these for a long time, right?

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:03.660
Like, I know some of the people, I think it was Cassini, the people who were on the project when it was getting planned and then built and then oversaw.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.240
That was many years, right?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.180
And so, did you drop into it while it was kind of already going a little bit?

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.960
Or were you there from the start for some of these?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.440
That's a very good question.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.900
That's a very good question.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.420
Of course, there's always this cliche saying of saying these missions are generation projects.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.840
And I just can confirm it.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.700
Totally right.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:28.220
Like, the proposal for Cassini was, I think, a year or so, a few years before I was born.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.660
And I'm now 32.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.660
So, it is indeed a generation project.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.100
Yeah.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.920
I had a full head of black hair when it started and then I was bald when it landed.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.080
You know, something like that, right?

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.420
That's going to be a totally reasonable statement.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.580
Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.880
I mean, these missions, they take a long time to prepare, to build and test.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.580
And then you have to fly there and get the data, derive conclusions.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.420
And I mean, still now, Cassini is gone since, like, I think, five years now.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.020
And there's still tons and tons of data that needs to be analyzed.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.940
And the same thing applies also for the Rosetta mission.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:00.460
Right.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:08.700
Once the either the mission is over because the spacecraft was destroyed on purpose, like Cassini was crashed into Saturn.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.800
So, it wouldn't potentially end up on one of the moons that could potentially have life and corrupt it.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.000
Right.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.020
Which is pretty, you have a lot of forethought or foresight there.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.600
Or it just, the mission is over, it returns.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.840
There's still, maybe the work almost just starts then, right?

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.180
If you're trying to understand all of this data and trying to tease out all the things that might be discovered.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.660
Yep.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:35.040
So, one example, I mean, Cassini, when it was launched in 1997, I think, machine learning was not really a big topic, right?

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.960
I mean, for example, support vector machines were invented in the 90s.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.960
And then the last couple of years, you had now deep learning and other new methods and more computation power.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.320
And now you have more and new ways of analyzing data.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.560
And this was, nobody was thinking about this when the mission started, right?

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.380
So, of course, with new methods on Earth, you can analyze the data from the past.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.620
And this applies for many other missions as well.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.700
So, this is amazing times.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.300
So, if anybody is interested in astronomy and Python, I mean, you can work with heritage data.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.500
It's pretty cool.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.620
And a lot of that data is public, right?

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.040
I don't know about ESA, but I know that NASA basically makes all of their data public.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.840
How about ESA?

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.880
Yes, that's right.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.320
So, NASA has a very good policy on this.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.360
ESA also, they have also their data.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.480
I'm not 100% sure they have like this.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.340
I think NASA has this PDS, Planetary Data System or so, where all the data are public.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:35.780
But I have to admit, I do not know the exact ESA policy.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.400
So, I knew that our data.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.020
We're public quite fast.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.860
So, we publish everything on the PDS system with description and documentation.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.400
But I can only speak for my team and not the others.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.240
I do not know what the general policy is, though.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:55.040
Yeah, pretty interesting and fortuitous because it's the inputs for a lot of your work that at

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:55.900
least we're discussing today.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.540
Absolutely.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.080
Yeah.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.320
Question from the audience real quick.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.720
Kim out there asks, as a ballpark, how much data does a mission like Cassini generate?

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.760
That's a good question.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.620
I think there was a poster a few years back, I think in 2017.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:13.920
And it was, let's say, in total, a large three-digit gigabyte number.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.980
So, like hundreds of gigabytes.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.300
Of course, one would say, I don't care.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.000
There's no big data for me.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.580
But you have to think that this is like really raw data, binary data.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.780
If you are decompressing the data, it's way, way more.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.960
So, for example, I was working on one instrument, the Cosmic Dust Analyzer.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:36.880
And after decompressing all the data and put them into an SQL database, we had like, I don't

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.040
know, like 200 gigabytes of data, right?

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.900
Compressed, it was only a fraction of it.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.380
So, it's really large number.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.420
And especially also the images take a lot of space.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:51.020
The other thing you got to think about is we don't have fiber from us to the spaceships,

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:51.340
right?

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.800
It's like a 2600 baud modem.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.360
Not actually, but in terms of the bandwidth all the way out to Saturn.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.000
That is not a high bandwidth connection, right?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.620
Absolutely.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:08.260
I mean, if I remember correctly, the Rosetta spacecraft had like, I think, 26k, like a 26k modem.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.380
So, it was before my time when the internet was created, let's say.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:17.700
And this underlines the importance of having good algorithms to compress the data and also

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.700
send the data in a smart way and also to analyze the data already on board, right?

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.600
So, for example, our instrument.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.260
Right.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.880
There's probably one level of filtering.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.380
Yeah.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:27.920
Yeah.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.640
Like our instrument on Fila.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.100
In fact, we would like to have all the signals, you know, every dimensionality and everything.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:39.760
But at the end, we were only able to extract certain attributes of the signals to derive

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.900
our scientific conclusions.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.780
So, yeah, there's always a caveat.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.140
Yeah.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:48.040
Well, even terrestrially, you know, on Earth, like CERN and Large Hadron Collider, they do

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.520
a bunch of processing right on those devices.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.500
Because even when you have fiber, it's still completely the amount of raw data blows it away.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.500
So, it's got to be trimmed down to something like, okay, well, we'll take 1% of the interesting

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.280
data and then look at that, which is still some tremendous number.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:02.500
Yeah.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.580
Final question, final follow-up on this, I suppose, before we move on.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:11.040
I saw some conversations or some write-ups about the Deep Space Network.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:11.800
Is that what it's called?

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.840
Where they passed the data around and reworking that to be higher bandwidth.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.140
Do you know anything about this?

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.960
I did not work on any network topics.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:25.400
But I remember as I saw these huge dishes and it's, I really can't say anything about the

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:25.660
bandwidth.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.040
It depends on the mission, right?

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:33.020
If you have a mission close to the sun or at moon, you can get megabytes of data within

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:33.460
minutes.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:38.140
But if you compare it, for example, with the Voyager missions that are really far beyond,

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:42.780
like it takes hours, the radio waves, it takes hours to get there and to come back.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.420
We are talking there about really bytes or bits per second, right?

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.500
Although you have a dish of 80 meters, like for example, in Australia or so.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:56.300
Improving this would probably improve the signal to noise ratio and everything to communicate

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.460
better with instruments that are far away.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.600
Like also New Horizons that is also now beyond Pluto.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.140
Yeah.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:02.820
Amazing.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:03.460
All right.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.320
Let's make our way over towards the YouTube side of things.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:14.160
So I ran across you over on Mastodon and what an interesting time it is that like there's

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.380
a new social network and people are kind of like finding a new way to do this thing we've

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.160
done for a long time.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.600
So I saw your profile like, okay.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:27.780
So it says former space scientists, ML engineer, creating Python and space and machine learning

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:28.660
tutorials on YouTube.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.780
I'm like, all right, I got to go watch these.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.340
And so I ended up on your YouTube channel and thinking just, you know, what a, what a

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.940
really cool project that you got going on there.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.640
And I wanted to share that with everyone, especially the data science folks.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:45.500
But even if you're just interested in a little bit of these data science tools, or, you know,

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:50.060
I can see this being really interesting for teachers, maybe high school and college who

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.620
want something slightly more interesting to show their students.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.560
Then we're going to load up the New York city taxi cab tipping data once again.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.080
And you're going to like, see that, you know, there's really a lot of cool possibilities

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.500
for things that are both pretty approachable, you know, not tons of code, but the results

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.020
are cool.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.700
And it's sort of inspiring in the sense that we talked about with space at the opening.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:16.220
Now, before we get into this, like specifically one thing I just want to get your thoughts on,

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.240
because this is really interesting.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:22.300
I mean, you hear people talk about how social media is really bad and there's filter bubbles

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:27.520
and there's like misinformation and absolutely acknowledging all those things are true.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:32.800
You know, places like YouTube, they just for all of their problems and all of their like

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.620
fail videos and memes of the day, there's a whole bunch of really, really incredible information.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:43.940
So for example, I had Dr. Becky on and she's got a, an incredible YouTube channel over there,

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.240
like half a million subscribers.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:51.580
You know, she does such a good job of being very real about talking about what she does

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.680
and as an astronomer and also sharing, you know, she does stuff where she's like sharing

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.780
notebooks on screen and whatnot, but it's still pretty informational.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.460
Another one that I really like is Astrum with Alex McCaugen.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:05.700
Just really, if you're just going to kick back and relax and watch something inspiring,

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.740
like this is a fantastic channel that people can check out.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:14.440
But what caught my attention about your work is just, it's so concrete, right?

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.880
It has this sort of inspirational, amazing things, but then you're like, now let me pull up the Cassini data

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.920
and let me throw that into pandas.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.120
And then there's a bunch of cool tools we'll talk about that used to visualize it.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:29.300
So maybe what are your thoughts on this YouTube as an educational resource compared to say like

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.500
discovery channel or history channel or these other places you think these are great pro documentaries.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.880
Like actually these are way crappier than these YouTube channels.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.500
It's amazing.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:41.800
Yeah, I think there are a lot of different channels out there for, let's say, different levels of knowledge, right?

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:46.940
I mean, like what you showed other channels, they would like to do something like public outreach.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.960
So they explain science maybe on the basic level.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.600
And it's pretty good and fair, right?

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:56.460
Because you reach more people, you reach a larger audience and make science more accessible to these people, right?

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.620
This applies for a lot of different science channels.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:08.280
Like we've also like Vsauce or so who made also science quite popular, you know, with his funny videos, with his funny beginnings and so on.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:15.240
And the thing I wanted to do is to introduce, let's say, this Python character to really work on the data.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.160
And I know that I will never reach the audience like the others, right?

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.080
Because the others, they, let's say, they have a different goal, right?

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.220
They want to make, let's say, popular science, so to speak, right?

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:26.980
To make it accessible.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:32.720
Here you have more requirements to understand that they have videos, like, for example, Python and so on.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:32.980
Yeah.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:37.600
So this is more like really for the people who are really into coding and so on.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.820
But I was thinking, and I just checked YouTube and I was thinking, well, there are coding videos out there.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:48.040
But this particular small spot, astronomy and Python, it was not, it was a gap.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:48.960
Nobody was filling it.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.780
And I was thinking, well, let's try it out and see how the response is.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.640
And I was writing on Reddit, on Twitter and so on with some people.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.700
And you talked about high school teachers.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.060
Actually, some teachers were writing me and said, hey, Thomas, this is pretty cool.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.380
Can I use your code?

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.600
And so I said, of course, everything is open source, right?

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.180
So you reach a different audience.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.820
We do not reach thousands or hundreds of thousands of people,

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.780
but people who like to interact with you, talk with you and have ideas and so on.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.620
This is pretty cool.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.200
And I like it.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:21.660
This portion of Talk Python To Me is sponsored by the Compiler podcast from Red Hat.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.040
Just like you, I'm a big fan of podcasts.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.020
And I'm happy to share a new one from a highly respected open source company.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.960
Compiler, an original podcast from Red Hat.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.380
Do you want to stay on top of tech without dedicating tons of time to it?

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.260
Compiler presents perspectives, topics and insights from the tech industry,

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.100
free from jargon and judgment.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.340
They want to discover where technology is headed beyond the headlines

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.760
and create a place for new IT professionals to learn, grow and thrive.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.840
Compiler helps people break through the barriers and challenges

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.060
turning code into community at all levels of the enterprise.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.400
One recent and interesting episode is there, the great stack debate.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.700
I love, love, love talking to people about how they architect their code,

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.060
the trade-offs and conventions they chose,

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.940
and the costs, challenges and smiles that result.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.000
This great stack debate episode is like that.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.100
Check it out and see if software is more like an onion or more like lasagna,

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.040
or maybe even more complicated than that.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.760
It's the first episode in Compiler's series on software stacks.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.860

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:33.260
but follow that link and click on your player's icon to add it.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.860
That way they know you came from us.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:39.580
Our thanks to the Compiler podcast for keeping this podcast going strong.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.440
It's really amazing.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:48.820
And also those people that you reach, many of them have an amplification effect, right?

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.760
Like somebody who watched Astrum probably just really enjoys it,

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.000
but somebody who watches your video might go do like a college lecture

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.060
or make it part of their course or sort of spread it further.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.600
So really, really, really cool.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.100
And so what we're going to do is we're going to go through a couple of your videos

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.580
and highlight some of the ideas.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.200
I don't know how long is your, you've got a playlist,

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.100
which I'll link to called Space Science with Python.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.800
It says how many videos, do you know how long it is?

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.080
About, let's look, roughly.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.180
Oh, good question.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.040
I have now over 60 videos.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.580
So this is like the main playlist.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.180
I have also near-earth objects and also machine learning.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:26.540
So I think in total, I would say each video is between 10 to 25 minutes.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.680
So in total, it's a few hours, let's say.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.480
If you're more familiar with Python, you can also, let's say,

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.280
take only a look at the Jupyter notebooks.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.240
So yeah, it really depends where you would like to start.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.920
And just small disclaimer,

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.240
my very first videos, the audio quality is not so good.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.320
And I'm really talking like a robot.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.360
So yeah, it was kind of difficult for me in the beginning,

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.300
but now it's way easier, let's say.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:50.960
Sure.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.460
Well, I can tell you the ones that I watched further down, perhaps,

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.700
are, they're really good, really nicely done.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.100
And I can definitely recommend them.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.660
And as somebody who has gone on this journey of creating stuff public, right?

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:07.660
If I go back and listen to episode one, two, or three of my show, there's a bunch of great stuff there.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.780
I'm just like, it's still a little bit of a cringeworthy type of thing, right?

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.460
So you're like, oh my gosh, listen to audio.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.760
And that echo, where's that echo?

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.300
Who didn't notice this echo, you know?

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:16.760
All right.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:24.500
So let's, before we dive into this, there's a couple of tools and libraries and stuff that I came across that were really,

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.900
some were new to me and some were really, really powerful.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.300
So you have all of your code, as you said, on GitHub.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.580
And we'll link to that.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:36.080
Maybe the first one, maybe it was its name, or you just used it a lot on some of the first videos that I watched.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.220
Spicy Pie.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.180
I mean, what a cool name.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:38.760
So what is this?

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.840
Tell us about Spicy Pie.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.460
Yeah.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:45.080
So Spicy Pie is based on a Python, on a toolkit from NASA.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.280
So NASA introduced Spice, like, I would say, decades ago, right?

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.080
It's a toolkit based on C, Fortran, I think also Java.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:59.000
And Spice is like, let's say, the tool to compute trajectories.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.360
So the movement, the path of planets, of spacecraft, and so on.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.620
But not only the movement, also, for example, the orientation of a spacecraft.

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.660
Where is my camera looking on Mars?

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.920
How is my instrument oriented with respect to Saturn and stuff like this?

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:20.340
So basically, every geometric question you would like to question, you can answer this with Spice.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.280
There was one caveat, though.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.480
There is no native support for Python.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.040
And there's a one, I think he's still a PhD student, Andrew Annex.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:35.840
And he was thinking, well, I write, I make a wrapper for the C library for Python.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.800
So he is doing this.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:43.180
And it's like an unofficial library of Spice, which we call now Spicy Pie.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.940
But it includes everything, really everything.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.120
And it's a little bit also kind of science.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:21:00.260
It's not easy to approach this toolkit, because if you look at the official NASA documentation, it's sometimes, by all due respect, please, it sometimes looks a little bit older, let's say, you know, like an older HTML site.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:04.260
I mean, the advantages that will remain for the next decades as well, right?

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.900
No fancy, no fancy front end stuff.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.760
I put it in the Wayback Machine and it looks the same.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.840
Something like that, right?

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:26.920
Yeah, and I try and Spicy Pie is something I use also my videos and try to help others or my viewers to approach this tool to compute trajectories, the positions of planets and so on, because you can do all these things with Spice.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.080
And Spicy Pie is the perfect wrapper for it.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.340
Yeah, it looks really, really easy to use.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:37.480
And that's the kind of thing that just, it seems really unapproachable without a little bit of help.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:43.240
On this day, at this second, how is Jupyter oriented over to Earth?

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:50.940
And if this comet is coming through at this angle, what's the distance between, you know, like those kinds of questions over time seem really tricky to answer.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.540
And it's those kinds of things you can do with Spicy Pie, right?

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.500
Exactly, yes.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.320
There's one small caveat, though.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.300
You have to know so-called kernels.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.760
So huge database with a lot of files where all the information is stored.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.820
But again, I also put it into my videos and there is some documentation on this.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:12.660
It's a, the learning curve is quite steep, but very, let's say, humbling in the beginning.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.660
I can imagine.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.660
Let's see.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:15.880
Yeah.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.280
So in a lot of your GitHubs, you'll have these kernel meta.txt.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.040
What is this here?

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.020
It's just a picture.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:29.920
And in here, it's got linked back to these particular files that have all the information that Spicy Pie needs, right?

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.300
So it's not completely standalone.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.560
You've got to provide it these files to work from, right?

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.020
Exactly.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.280
So I put these kernels that I use for my tutorials also in the GitHub repository.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.140
And for example, these three kernels is like the second one.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.360
You see this 0012.tls.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.620
It's something that contains time information.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:52.980
So you may know every four years you have a leap day, a day you have to add in your calendar, right?

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.400
But there's only half the truth.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:58.200
There are also so-called leap seconds and leap milliseconds and what's or not.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:02.480
And these crucial information are stored in these files, for example.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.820
And you need to load them to convert time.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:09.140
Well, you know, we don't care that much about a leap second here and there on Earth.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:14.960
But if you're traveling for 10 years at 30,000 miles an hour, 50,000 kilometers an hour,

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.180
off by one second might mean you don't make it to the right place, right?

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:18.720
Exactly.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:24.180
I mean, with SPICE, you also compute the orientation, for example, of your dishes to the spacecraft.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.460
And pointing is very, very crucial.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.660
I mean, light speed is not instant, right?

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.880
It also takes some time.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:35.420
So you have to be really careful and really precise with your scientific work and alignment.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.400
I suppose you do.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.880
I was thinking of spaceships, but I wasn't thinking of light.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.020
But you're right.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:41.540
It totally does.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.220
Another question for the audience.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:48.640
Are those kernels effectively enormous tables of data about where Jupyter will be at a given time and stuff like that?

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.820
Basically, yeah, in a way they are.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:54.400
But they are also, they are different kernels with different precision.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:24:00.160
So for example, for the solar system, you have very precise kernels that cover a year, for example.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.200
And you have maybe less precise kernels that cover 50,000 years or so.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:04.700
Yeah.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:09.200
So there are like really, really different kernels that cover different time ranges with different

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:09.780
precisions.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.420
But you're basically right.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:16.280
And let's say the art is to create your own kernels with your own methods and so on.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.220
This is something I did not cover yet.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.680
But we will get to this in the future.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.340
Okay.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:21.380
More videos to come.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.560
All right.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.420
So we spoke about spicy pie.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:24.900
Excellent.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.980
Another one you want to give a shout out to was AstroML.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:33.320
AstroML was my first contact point with machine learning, actually.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.300
So they have this package called AstroML.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:42.020
And it's also, if you scroll down a little bit, then you will see also a book, which is called,

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.160
it's a very long title, Data Mining.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.660
Oh yeah, there are statistics, data mining, machine learning, and astronomy.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:52.760
And it's a book that covers space or astronomy, Python, and machine learning.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.560
And this is like, I like this book.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.680
I mean, I'm not getting paid for the advertisement or so.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.080
I really read through it.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.940
I went through the tutorials and so on.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.260
The tutorials, some notebooks are for free.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:08.340
And this is an extreme good resource to also get in touch with machine learning, Python, and

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:08.740
astronomy.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.860
And it covers a lot of topics.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:16.780
So if you have nothing to do for Christmas time, just take the book a few hours per day

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.640
and go through it.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.100
Yeah.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:18.500
Okay.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.160
Fantastic.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.160
And what kind of questions do you answer with AstroML?

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.320
Like when would you use it?

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:29.880
So AstroML has, for example, they have a lot of examples of star data and also extragalactical

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.180
data.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:36.160
So for example, spectra, so-called spectra of galaxies, like a galaxy has a certain color.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:36.460
Yeah.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:41.760
So the color is like in physics, it's like a spectrum, different wavelengths or also active

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.220
galaxies and so on.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:46.580
And then with AstroML, you can, for example, identify clusters.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:46.880
Yeah.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.280
You can classify the galaxies into different categories.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.360
For example, you have also the galaxy scattered all over the sky.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:26:00.000
They're using, for example, clustering algorithms to identify certain structures in the night sky.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.960
So we have like huge so-called groups or so of galaxies.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:09.300
And of course you can make your own empirical models, or you can also, for example, use

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.360
unsupervised machine learning methods to identify these huge clusters of galaxies.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.880
And these are like one or two examples they cover with this book.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.260
Cool.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:17.700
Yeah.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:23.060
You can understand things like based on the general color of the galaxy, it might be a

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:27.560
different age because the stars are older and the older stars burn in a different light

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.020
than like a bright new blue star, right?

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:30.540
Correct.

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:30.840
Yes.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.360
Yeah.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:31.680
Excellent.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.800
And then one thing, I don't think I pulled it up.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.020
Is it VizViz with a Z or VizViz with an S?

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.080
It's with an S.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.280
We're going to find out.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.020
Let's see how well.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:40.480
Yeah.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.900
Now you got to be careful when you search live for things.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:43.560
Yeah.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.160
Here we go.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.280
On the top.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:45.580
Yes.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.420
Oh yeah.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.020
It's all good.

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:47.700
It's all fine.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:48.160
Perfect.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.040
So you'll see this make an appearance as well.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:57.480
And you tell us about VizViz because it's not, as you pointed out, it's not particularly popular

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.420
in terms of use.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.180
It's got like right now, 198 stars.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.420
But wow, it looks really incredible for exploring data.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.220
Tell us about this.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.780
I'm still wondering why it only has 200 stars.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:08.380
So...

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:09.280
Well, we're going to double it today.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.020
Let's say, let's go a little bit to the history.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.200
Let's push it.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.900
So maybe a little bit of history, why I found this.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:19.860
What I liked at the beginning or retrospectively, what I liked when I started using Python, I had

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.500
no ideas about libraries, right?

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.820
I was completely unbiased.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:23.560
What is NumPy?

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.400
What is Pandas?

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:24.980
I don't care.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:25.500
I don't know.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:30.300
So I was really searching in an unbiased way for a visualization tool for 3D rendering.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.760
And I found this VizViz.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.280
At this point, I had like 30 stars or so.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:38.720
And I was like, huh, this looks really nice to make some animations of videos, for example,

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.380
of asteroids.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.340
And I was also writing a little bit with the author and saying, hey, I would like to...

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.260
I have some questions.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.000
Can you help me?

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.680
He helped me also because I was a beginner.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.400
And over the last...

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.820
Over the years, I've always used it for my animations.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:55.180
Also on my YouTube channel, you'll find like two videos of the Rosetta space for like a trajectory

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:55.720
and so on.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.580
No fancy animation, just simple and easy.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:03.340
And you can also use it, for example, to read in shape data of, for example, comets or

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:08.520
asteroids, really like the 3D things and then render them in OpenGL, play around and have

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.100
a feeling.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:09.440
Yeah.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.100
How does a comet look like?

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.500
And this package supports it out of the box.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.920
And I'm extremely impressed.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.580
And I'm also, let's say, negatively impressed that it's still 200 stars.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.980
So shout out to Alma Klein and his VizViz package.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:26.840
This is something that I use now since the beginning, since 10 years now.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.320
Yeah.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.040
It's what I saw you doing that was really, really cool.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.380
We'll maybe see this in one of the videos, but you create a...

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:38.380
Take a 3D shape of the comet, a very high resolution one, lots of polygons.

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:42.940
Render that in a way that you can rotate and zoom in and explore it.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:47.660
And then on top of that, you said, well, let's plot the path of the Phileas lander that landed

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:52.020
on it that you worked on and how it moved around in this like 3D space.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.320
And you can rotate it and look at the elevation.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:29:01.480
We have in Python, we have such a treasure, so many choices of visualization libraries.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.480
I think that partly might be having some to do with it because it's just like, well,

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:09.280
there's these 400 things to choose from to visualize my data.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.000
Where do I start?

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.080
So maybe people stick more to the most common ones, you know?

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:13.580
Exactly.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.300
I mean, matplotlib, I mean, it's super fair, right?

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.180
Also for scientific plotting and so on.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:24.600
But especially 3D rendering and so on, it's quite rare to find something impressive, easy

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.060
to use and something that has good performance, right?

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:27.560
Right.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.340
And is interactive.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:28.820
Yeah.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:29.480
Absolutely.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:29.780
Yeah.

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:30.300
All right.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.540
Let's start.

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:35.560
This first video, I asked you to pull out a couple of videos that you thought were interesting.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.740
And the first one is the asteroid flyby.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:44.520
So maybe tell us a bit about this particular video, what you were trying to demonstrate.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:49.580
And I'll pull up maybe this JPL small body database and look at the source code a little

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.080
bit too.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:50.680
Yeah, sure.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:56.560
So some of you of the viewers or listeners may have some science feeds, right?

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.160
Like you have some news, like for example, I don't know, killer asteroid is flying towards

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.420
earth or something like that.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.100
And then you read the article and it's...

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.000
I saw a movie about that once.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.920
People had to run.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.180
It created this giant tsunami.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.720
In golf, New York.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.640
Yeah, exactly.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.500
And then you read the article and it's put it into a perspective.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.980
Ah, it's not dangerous at all.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.820
And it's like X, Y, Z kilometers or miles passes by.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.220
And well, you cannot really grasp this as a reader, right?

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.820
What is 50 million kilometers?

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.580
Is it a lot?

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:25.680
Is it not a lot?

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.520
You know, you don't get really a feeling.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:33.200
And I was thinking, well, let's take a particular example like this one here, 2021 WP.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.120
What a nice name.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:39.520
And let's see how many miles or kilometers it has a flyby, right?

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.760
And this applies not only for this object, it applies for several other objects.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:47.900
And if you know how to compute these things, if you know your, for example, Matplotlib routines

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:52.620
and so on, then you get a maybe better feeling and understanding that sometimes a close flyby,

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.140
let's say it's not that close, right?

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:59.420
So you know that, for example, it has like, I don't know, certain distance.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:04.160
And then you convert it, for example, to a factor of the distance between moon and earth.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:08.040
And then it says, yeah, it's the distance 100 times between earth and moon.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.280
And you think like, well, in my world, that's not a close flyby.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:17.260
Of course, astronomical scale it is, but it's not comparable to a flyby of, let's say, 2000 kilometers,

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:17.700
right?

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:18.120
Right.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:22.940
So this helps a little bit to understand the data, to understand what's going on there.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:27.680
And then also to visualize it and see, okay, what does it mean close flyby, right?

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.520
So I think that's quite helpful to understand that.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.220
I think it is.

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:35.580
And one of the things you did here a lot was you said, okay, well, let's look at this.

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:39.460
And when you get the answers, you would say, well, we're going to not necessarily talk about

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.300
it in miles, but you would divide it by one LD.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.060
What is that distance to the moon?

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:45.680
Yes.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.360
The lunar distance, for example.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:47.660
Yeah.

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:47.900
Yeah.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.360
Lunar distance.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:48.780
That's right.

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.720
So we have like two metrics.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:50.920
Yeah.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.420
The lunar distance and the so-called sphere of influence.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.540
That's something else.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.340
It's a larger sphere, virtual sphere.

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:56.720
Yeah.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:01.400
So if people want to go through this one, this one, I would say really takes advantage of

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.760
spicy pie, right?

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.140
You do a couple of things.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.800
You say, we're going to load up all the data about this asteroid.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.820
We're going to load up the data about the earth and the moon and the sun and try to put

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.160
all these things together using spicy pie, right?

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:14.820
Exactly.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:20.220
So most or some people who know a little bit about physics here, they say, well, you need

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.800
always this multi-body simulation.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:28.420
You need to know the gravitational influence of the sun, the moon, of Mars and earth and so

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:28.580
on.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:32.780
But sometimes, and this is also something I show here, you can reduce it to a simple two-body

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:33.200
problem.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:38.460
You just assume that the earth has a certain gravitational influence up to a certain range.

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:46.380
And then you check if the asteroid is, for example, passing or crossing the so-called

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:47.400
sphere of influence.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:52.700
I think for earth, it's like, I don't want to lie, 600,000 miles, respectively, a million

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.640
kilometers or so, something like that.

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.180
Is it three or four lunar distances?

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:56.940
Yeah.

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:57.700
Something like this.

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:57.920
Yeah.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.020
2.4 or something.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:32:59.200
Yeah.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.200
It's even written there, right?

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:00.500
Yeah.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.600
And this is, and then you switch, for example, between different coordinate systems and you

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.400
ignore the sun and then you only consider the earth and so on.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:12.580
And of course, it's not as precise as an embodied simulation, but it helps to understand

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:15.840
what is the influence of each individual body in the solar system.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:22.280
This portion of Talk Python is brought to you by the AWS Insiders podcast.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:28.080
When was the last time you ordered a physical server to host your functions as a service, your

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.220
latest API, or your most recent web app?

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:31.900
I remember the last time I did.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.940
That was around the year 2001.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.100
And yes, it was quite the odyssey.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.300
Of course, we don't do that anymore.

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:43.740
We run our code in the cloud with near instant provisioning and unparalleled data centers.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:47.360
And the most popular cloud provider is AWS.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:54.660
But for all the ways that AWS has made our lives easier, it has also opened a massive box of choices.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.600
Should you choose platform as a service, or maybe it's still VMs with IaaS?

00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.840
What about your database?

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.460
Maybe you should choose a managed service like RDS with Postgres?

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.560
Or is DynamoDB better?

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.380
Maybe Aurora?

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.180
No, wait.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.900
I hear good things about Amazon DocumentDB too.

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:13.200
And that's where the AWS Insider podcast comes in.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:18.460
This podcast helps technology leaders stay ahead of Amazon's constant pace of change and innovation.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:30.340
Some relevant recent episodes include Storage Wars Database Edition, Microservices or Macro Disaster, and exploring computer vision at the edge with AWS Panorama.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:35.240
They bring on guests to debate the options, and the episodes are vibrant and fun.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:42.500
So if you want to have fun and make sense of AWS, head on over to talkpython.fm/AWS Insiders.

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:47.100
Yes, I know you probably already have a podcast player, and you can just search for it there.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.680
But please use the link so that they know you came from us.

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:55.560
Thank you to the AWS Insider podcast for keeping this podcast going strong.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:10.100
Yeah, so another thing you did on this one is you went through and said, let's figure out when this 2021 WP asteroid enters the Earth's sphere of influence and see how much it will be affected.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.580
How much will its trajectory be altered through there, right?

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:23.060
Yes, so there are also books of astrodynamical theories where you can use some equations and, yeah, for example, predict the changes a little bit.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:30.180
But here with this example, with this particular example, you get really a feeling and understanding how is the orbit altered, right?

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:34.620
And of course, if it's closer to the Earth, it's more severe than outside.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.060
Also the dwell time.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:42.160
So how long is the object in the sphere of influence with what kind of velocity, inclination angle, and so on.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.500
So it's a very multidimensional problem.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:45.180
It's not trivial.

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:49.300
You really have to have a feeling, understanding, and simulate this a little bit.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:54.260
And then you see how Earth affects its cosmic vicinity, right?

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:57.760
Especially the smaller objects like the small asteroids and comets.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.140
Yeah.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:10.720
And just for people listening and not seeing this at the moment, the code that you wrote to figure out when will the thing enter the sphere of influence, given it starts way back when it was detected or whatever.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.440
It's only like 11 or 12 lines of code.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.180
It's not super complicated stuff.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:19.460
Putting together things like Panda and SpicyPy and some simple Python.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:22.800
And that includes two lines of reporting, I suppose, as well, doesn't it?

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.260
So it's pretty approachable, I think.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:28.080
It's not obvious at first because SpicyPy has weird functions you got to call.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.980
But once you know, like, this is the one I need, then it's not hard at all.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:31.800
Exactly right.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.760
I mean, this is how everybody of us started programming in a way, right?

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:39.820
We made maybe some overkill functions and for loops and what's or not, right?

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.960
And after time, you get a better feeling and understanding.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.280
And of course, even this code, you could probably improve even more.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:52.760
But I try to find a balance between, let's say, length of the code and also if the reader can comprehend it or not, right?

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.300
I mean, I could put everything in one line.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.420
Nobody would understand it.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.180
And I could say, well, it looks elegant.

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.060
Yeah.

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.120
But I try to make it explainable.

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.340
Yeah, there's definitely a balance of like, just don't use things too fancy.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.340
Just make it approachable.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.920
I think along these lines, there's a question from Martin.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:11.120
It says, is there a primer to understanding trajectories of near-earth objects?

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:16.180
It's great to have the data, but you might be limited in what you can do if you're not a subject matter expert.

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.980
I think this video actually is not a bad start, but what would you say?

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.780
Yeah, that's a very good question.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:26.080
I'm currently doing a small series on this near-earth object topic because, yeah, the orbital elements,

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.760
you have to understand orbital elements.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.940
What are orbital elements?

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.220
You can generate a lot of insights in there.

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.460
But this is what I try to approach a little bit and help, right?

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:35.740
With all the small videos.

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.720
I think you see here, yeah, near-earth objects.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.600
It's still not finished.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.600
Yeah, you've got a whole playlist on it with 12 videos, right?

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.040
Yeah.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.780
I think a new one will follow the next couple of days.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:49.220
And the thing is, so the person who asked the question is totally right.

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:52.280
You have to have some kind of understanding of these concepts.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.520
I try also to make some concept videos.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.080
You see on the right hand side.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.900
It's not related to Python at all.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.140
And I have to apologize.

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:00.340
I'm not like a...

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:01.500
I don't have a million subscribers.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:04.420
I don't have the animation skills to do these things.

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:05.860
Yeah, like good animations.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:11.040
And so I really try to make it like a lecture in the university to make it as understandable,

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.540
approachable as possible.

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:18.460
But yeah, you have to dive also into the physics sometimes to really understand what's going on.

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:23.700
But the good thing about, especially asteroids and so on, the learning curve is also very steep.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.640
You get really easily into this topic.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.500
So just read one hour book about orbital elements or two hours and you can start.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:30.920
Yeah.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.500
And you've got a whole YouTube channel full of recommendations there.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:33.860
Awesome.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:34.220
Okay.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:37.080
And so I guess to wrap this one up, you went through and you...

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:42.640
There's a bunch of orbital element properties in the JPL database that like the eccentricity,

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.640
and the peri...

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.160
Remind me what peri is?

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.120
Yeah, I can explain maybe one, two values.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.200
So to demystify these numbers, right?

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.620
I mean, these numbers are really complex.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:58.680
But for example, the eccentricity, you can say this value is between zero and one.

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:02.600
Zero means it's a perfect circle and very close to...

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.340
And the more it goes to one, it's more and more an elliptic.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.100
It's more and more like shaped like an egg.

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:12.000
And if it's larger than one, then it will just make one revolution around the sun.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.020
And then it goes au revoir into the outer space.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:19.660
A Q, for example, is the closest distance this object will have with the sun.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:25.980
And 0.93 means it's 93% of the distance between earth and sun.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.460
So this is like really just a value.

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:35.100
It's like very, very close to 140 million kilometers or 80 million miles.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.480
And the inclination is also another value.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.780
Let's say this is the last one.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:39.820
We have the earth.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.360
Now imagine you have a table.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.340
You know, the table.

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:44.020
So for the listeners, you have a table.

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.240
You put a small ball in the center.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:46.920
That's your sun.

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.900
Now you have a second ball rolling around the sun.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:50.540
That's the earth.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:54.780
And the plane, the table is your so-called ecliptic plane.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.360
But not every object is moving on this plane.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:03.420
Now you have sometimes objects that are a little bit inclined, maybe by a few degrees or even 80 or 90 degrees.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:07.000
This inclination is actually called inclination i.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.620
And here it's, for example, 3.5, 3.8 degrees.

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.420
So these are the three elements you know now.

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.780
And it's quite easy to understand on the meta level.

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:16.220
Yeah.

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.020
Yeah, for sure.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:23.140
So when you do all of your math, you come back and say, well, let me check this back against these numbers.

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:24.020
How close are we?

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:27.860
You know, how close do we get to predicting what JPL said it was?

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:28.100
Right.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.680
So that's kind of a cool way to check.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:29.960
Yeah.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.820
I mean, there's like JPL has the data.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.240
They've also, the Minor Planet Center has some data.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.240
So they always deviate a little bit, right?

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:43.980
If you're, let's say, plus minus 1% or so or 0.1%, you can reach this with very simple Python scripts.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.340
And I think that's quite fair results, right?

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.940
I mean, you don't have the ambition to write a highly scientific paper.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:52.200
At the end, you can live with this.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.460
And you have to be careful.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.340
Also, you have like tons of numbers here.

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:58.100
And it suggests the precision that's not really existing.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:58.360
Right.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.980
Because the precision is limited by the uncertainty.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.980
So the uncertainty is like really the cap.

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:03.940
And that's it.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:10.200
One final thing I suppose to talk about before we move off this video is you talk about describing

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.080
where this comet, it's an asteroid, right?

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:13.600
Not a comet.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.180
Or no, it was a comet or asteroid.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:15.780
Which one is it?

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.640
Actually, I don't know.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.960
It could be one of these things.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.400
It's nobody written if it's an asteroid or a comet.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.600
So most likely it's an asteroid, but you don't know.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:22.940
Yeah.

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:23.280
Okay.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.940
So it comes shooting by and you talk about, okay, well, let's use the solar.

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.420
We're coordinates to talk about it.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:33.000
And then when it gets close enough, like gets into the sphere of influence and go, let's

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.900
switch it over to the earth oriented where earth is at the zero, zero point coordinates.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:41.400
And we can, as it's closer, as we can talk about it relative to us, and then it shoots

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.660
back out and like switch it back to the solar.

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:47.200
Maybe talk real quickly about like how you think about that.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:47.540
Yeah.

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:49.340
Those already explained it pretty well.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:55.360
I mean, this is how you can compute the change of orbits of asteroids without some heavy

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.680
N-body simulation.

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:59.620
You just switch between coordinate systems with different centers.

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:01.320
And Michael, you explained it perfectly.

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.360
It is the way how you described it.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:07.580
So it's a very, let's say, simple approach, but you can implement it quickly.

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.860
And it's really nice to see the results.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:13.880
And it's great to think of as a human, like how far is it from earth and what direction

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.220
is it?

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:18.040
Like talking about from the sun, when you're trying to see how it relates to you, it makes

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:18.620
less sense.

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.180
And the math to do, it's pretty easy.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:25.240
You just subtract, you know, do vector subtraction or addition for pandas rays, right?

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:25.720
Absolutely.

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:26.580
Yeah, you're right.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:27.480
It's basically it.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:27.660
Yeah.

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:28.060
Cool.

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:28.480
Okay.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.700
Next one here, a comet in 3D.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.300
And this is where you talk, where you show vis-vis.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.980
Let's talk about this comet.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:39.380
This is why I was confused whether it's a comet or asteroid or actually, yeah, it says comet.

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:39.900
It's a comet.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:40.280
Yes.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:40.620
Yeah.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:40.800
Good.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.100
Okay.

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:41.500
Got it.

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:42.480
I got it right.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.600
So tell us about this thing, this 67P.

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.160
What is this?

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:53.860
So this was the main, or this was the scientific objective or goal of the Rosetta Fila mission

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.040
by ESA, right?

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.880
So ESA was sending the probe several years ago.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.600
I think it was 2004, I think.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.780
And it started to a 10 year journey to this comet.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.660
And this comet is a so-called periodic comet.

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:11.560
So it revolves around our sun and the maximum distance from the sun is somewhere around

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.000
Jupyter.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.940
So it's not like the heli comet, for example, that comes back every 90 or a hundred years.

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.780
It's like a regular visitor, but a very small one.

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.820
And ESA was thinking, well, that's a perfect goal.

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.380
Let's go there and see how this thing looks like.

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:31.200
And so they were sending the Rosetta spacecraft there and this came closer and closer in 2014

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:35.380
until the Rosetta spacecraft reached its final orbit, was deploying the lander.

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:36.540
Everybody was happy.

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:42.640
But in the meantime, the spacecraft made more and more and more images of this comet from

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.440
different angles.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:49.520
So like a huge stereoscopic camera, you can derive 3D information.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:54.600
And this 3D information is then going through some algorithms I'm not familiar with.

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:59.500
And then at the end, you get this shape model, as you said in the beginning of the podcast,

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.300
this polygon shape, right?

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.340
And this polygon shape is free data.

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.500
It's freely accessible.

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:08.320
And I just downloaded it and do some data crunching.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.900
And then I used this to visualize it.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:17.240
And then you can see really the different structures, how this two ball shape looks like.

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:21.480
You know, some people describe it as a rubber duck with a small head and a larger body.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:26.700
And you will also see in this 3D that there is like a night site that's always in the night.

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:28.080
So you don't know how it looks like.

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:31.880
It's very, the 3D model is very smooth because you don't have any information there.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:38.940
So it's pretty impressive to see how this model has been derived with data from millions of miles

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:39.380
away.

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:43.460
And now you can really reconstruct the comet on your small laptop.

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:49.020
Yeah, the one that you reconstructed with Python looks not the level of detail of maybe some of

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:53.800
the very highest resolution pictures here, but it looks pretty believable that those are the

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.900
same things, which is quite amazing.

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.020
Yeah, absolutely.

00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.880
I mean, of course, the images are way better.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:03.880
You said it's small and it is small, but it's approximately four kilometers.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.580
It's not just a little pebble in space.

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.460
It's a kind of a thing, right?

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:09.660
It's somewhat big.

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:14.980
Yeah, it's, let's say, if this object would hit or fly it towards Earth, we would have a

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.240
problem, let's say, right?

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.700
They really would make a movie about that one.

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:18.900
Yeah.

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:20.140
Oh, yeah.

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:23.900
That's a, I don't know, some heroes can go there and crush the comet.

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:24.740
Exactly.

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:28.360
I need to get the old space shuttle out of storage.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:28.640
Yep.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:34.260
But if you compare, for example, Sharia of Gerasimenko with other comets like the heli

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:38.920
comet, it's, let's say, it has larger cousins out there, which are also brighter, and you

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.600
see them also in the night sky when they have, they pass by.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:45.380
And this comet, you really do not see in the night sky from Earth.

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:50.360
So this is what, let's say, I would say is small because I cannot really see it with the

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:50.780
naked eye.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:54.060
Yeah, it's still small in terms of planets and stuff.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:57.740
But it's not entirely small compared to, say, I don't know.

00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:59.280
If it were to hit us, we would notice.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:45:59.800
All right.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.700
So let me pull up a little bit of this picture.

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:06.340
So the first thing that I think is interesting in this video, which is space science with

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:12.740
Python part 22, comet in 3D, you said a lot of stuff you're doing directly in Visual Studio

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:15.800
code using the notebook format, which is pretty interesting.

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:20.480
This one you switched over to Jupyter and you started using Qt, right?

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:25.520
Qt, PyQt, to bring up this interactive window, which, you know, you create a little window

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:31.380
and show it and pair that with VizViz, which, you know, maybe, and where's that fit into your

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:31.700
world?

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:35.360
Like a lot of people, I think, kind of just stick with notebooks and output, whatever they

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.780
can get into the interactive widget inside the notebook.

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:38.340
Yeah.

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.720
So I really like VS Code, right?

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:45.900
I mean, one of the main features I use, especially also at work, is something called remote containers.

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:51.180
So you have a Docker container with your entire working environment and you can share it with

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.880
people on Windows, Mac, Linux, really doesn't matter, right?

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.040
This was, this is pretty, it's game changer, right?

00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:02.140
But with PyQt, I was somehow not able to create this interactive widget out of the Docker

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:02.660
container.

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:07.420
So yeah, of course, but I was really playing around and try these things out, you know,

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:10.440
but at the end I was saying, you know what, it's fine.

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.760
Let's use a simple virtual environment.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:17.100
Let's keep it running on the native JupyterLab environment and it's fine.

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:22.180
So this is where I was like saying, I cannot do everything, right?

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:23.880
This was really my nemesis.

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.500
I don't think I'd be able to get that going either.

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:31.100
So you pull this thing up and it initially doesn't have any shading or anything, but it

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:34.300
looks quite like what you would expect there.

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:38.960
Let me eventually get it going with like shadows and light sources.

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:40.680
It's a pretty cool achievement.

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.620
And this is all that VizViz library, right?

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:43.220
Exactly.

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:43.580
Yes.

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:45.620
So VizViz is doing it.

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:45.800
Yeah.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.780
And it also was part of our science paper you see now here.

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:53.780
So for the podcast listeners, there's a key paper at astronomy and astrophysics.

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:58.240
And it was about the landing of the instrument also with our best instrument.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:02.860
And yeah, the analysis you see here also here, figure four was done with matplotlib.

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:07.420
So Python and space is not only like filling YouTube videos and making tutorials.

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:08.980
It's really used in science.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:14.140
So I know also a lot of other people using Python now and you see it every day now.

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:15.500
Same tools we all have, right?

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:15.840
Yeah.

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:21.260
In the next video, you know, this one, I could tell this really was a personal, like this meant

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.140
a lot to you when you put it out into the world.

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:27.980
The Philaeus is landing because this is what one of the projects you were directly involved

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:28.320
in, right?

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:29.220
Yes, exactly.

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:32.420
So I was part of the so-called dust impact monitor.

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:38.760
You can imagine it's a small cube, like a Rubik's cube, and it was detecting dust particles

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:43.380
or the task was to detect dust particles with something, you know, from your e-guitars.

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:43.840
Yeah.

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.220
So something called piezo crystals.

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:46.540
Yeah.

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:47.520
You're playing your guitar.

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:51.760
The vibrations go into some kind of crystal and the crystal is translating the vibration

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:52.780
into an electric signal.

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:58.320
And we use the same principle here to convert impacts of dust particles on our instrument

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:03.320
to learn something about their properties, like velocity, size and shape and so on.

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:06.960
And this was the paper you also saw just one second ago.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:12.280
And we were, our instrument was on during the landing process where we also catch some data.

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:12.760
Yeah.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:13.280
Amazing.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:18.680
And one of the pictures you got here in this video is of, that's Rosetta, right?

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.540
The lander or no, this is Philaeus, the thing that was sent down.

00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.040
Exactly.

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:22.940
Philaeus, the lander.

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:23.340
Yeah.

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:26.300
And it's really high res picture, I guess, taken from Rosetta.

00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:29.020
And it's, you can see it on this rocky cliff.

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:32.400
It eventually found its way into this little crack where it's kind of, it's kind of stuck

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:32.840
there, right?

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:37.320
But what science did you get out of it before it got stuck in that crack and lost its solar

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:37.640
power?

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:38.500
That's a good question.

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:41.840
So a lot of different instruments were involved, right?

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:46.700
So I can say for our instrument, we had like this dust impact monitor and during the descent

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:48.960
phase, we had one impact.

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.340
So we detected exactly one particle.

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:52.480
It's not a lot.

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:56.540
I know instrument was not big, but at least we detected something because we wanted to have

00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:59.380
main science work on the surface.

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:04.900
Now, since we landed in this cave or cavity or what's or not, we detect, we were not able

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:06.140
to detect anything, right?

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.020
We were, a lot of power was low.

00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:13.760
So also other instruments were running there like instruments to generate, to create, get

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:20.320
out some samples to measure also a little bit the gas environment and so on to extract hopefully

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.800
some organic material and so on.

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.660
So every instrument was running.

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:29.900
Also a small hammer was hammering on the surface to see how hard is the surface.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.380
And it was really hard.

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:36.720
So yeah, FIDO was running for a few days, I think, until the battery eventually ran out

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:39.260
and you see it was stuck in this shadow.

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.220
So the battery was not able to recharge.

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:42.680
And this was the end of the mission.

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:46.320
That's a little too bad that it got in the shadow, but still really cool.

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:52.100
People might not think there's going to be very much gas to detect, but like a lot of

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:55.960
comets, it was when it got close to the sun, it was shooting a bunch of gas out of it, right?

00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:01.120
So it didn't have an atmosphere at four kilometers, but it did have gas coming off of it.

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:01.780
Yeah, exactly.

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.080
You're perfectly right.

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:06.600
So gas and dust and a lot of activity was going on.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:09.540
So of course, as a human, you couldn't breathe this stuff, right?

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:14.580
It's very, very, it's not the high density, but yeah, there was a lot of stuff going on and

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:17.200
you can really measure it and you can detect it.

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:22.740
And I think also Rosetta, if I'm not mistaken, was sometimes hit by some dust particles and

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:24.580
you see them also in the camera system later.

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:28.620
So there's a lot of activity going on there on this tiny worlds.

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:32.980
And it's amazing to see that we were able to get there and measure it and see it in real

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:33.320
time.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:34.700
This is really, really, really cool.

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:35.680
It's really amazing.

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:41.000
So if you go toward for this particular video, if you go into one thing, I just want to give

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:41.700
you credit for.

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:43.800
I do this with my YouTube videos as well.

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:46.960
Not the podcast, but the ones that are specifically made for YouTube.

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.220
It's putting chapters in.

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:51.620
It's really nice to have chapters like, okay, this is the section that I, you know, this

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:52.920
two minute segment is really nice.

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.960
Like here's where you're computing this thing or you're rendering that thing.

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:56.780
And it's nice.

00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:03.420
So if you go over to the rebounces task section, you can see a really cool little animation

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:07.960
of you putting that together, you know, drawing the line and maybe tell us about this.

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.080
This goes back to VizViz being pretty neat as well.

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:10.340
Yeah.

00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:11.840
So this was the information.

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:17.080
So Fila was supposed to land on some area and stay there, but unfortunately it was really,

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:21.420
really bouncing, you know, so for a few couple of times, I don't know how many times, two,

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:22.040
three times.

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.220
We can use now my video to check it.

00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:27.380
And well, the data is quite precise.

00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:32.200
So we have a very precise shape model and we have a very precise reconstruction of the

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.340
trajectory of the lander.

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:35.460
So path that Fila was taking.

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:41.300
And yeah, and I was just taking this totally different sources of data sources and merging

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:41.880
them together.

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:48.340
And this was using this high QT framework that's under the hood and you see it fitted perfectly.

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:51.600
The trajectory really is on the surface, you know, bouncing there.

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.220
And then you see at the end, the bottom right now.

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:59.680
So for the listeners now, there's like the end of the trajectory in the small shadow hills.

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:00.340
Yeah.

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:01.940
Where Fila died.

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:04.340
Or it got into that gavern, went to the cavern.

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:04.620
Yeah.

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:05.540
Went to rest.

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:05.820
Yeah.

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:06.680
The big sleep.

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.300
Exactly.

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:08.640
Yes.

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:13.820
I guess what surprised me about this is just how precisely this 3D model that was

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:21.180
made of the stereoscopic image data and then the reconstruction of the lander in this 3D

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:22.820
space, like it lines up perfectly.

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:26.360
Like you said, you know, even as you rotate it in three dimensions, you're like, I look at

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:26.840
it from this angle.

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:29.340
It's like, wow, that really is pretty accurate.

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.200
Yeah, absolutely.

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:35.220
I'm also always impressed how, I mean, in a science community and also an industry, right?

00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:37.200
Everybody's playing a small part, right?

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.160
But you play a part.

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:42.120
And at the end to see the end product, it's like, it's amazing, right?

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:43.940
I mean, in science, it's like this, right?

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:45.280
It's like, wow, cool.

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.220
We were able to generate the data.

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.620
I mean, I have the same feeling as an industry, right?

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:51.980
It's like, oh my God, look at the product at the end.

00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:55.420
You know, you're just, you did this very small part, but it's, you're part of it.

00:53:55.420 --> 00:54:01.180
And it's always nice to see how this mosaic puzzle is getting together at the end, right?

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:02.960
And providing useful insights.

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:03.960
It's pretty unbelievable.

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.780
Yeah, it really, it really is.

00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:06.940
All right, let's see.

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:08.240
What else do I want to say about it?

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:10.100
I guess we're getting kind of short on time here.

00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:16.160
Let's talk about this AI 112, the autoencoder latent space visualization one.

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:19.020
So this is more close to your current work, right?

00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:22.100
This ML work with space science, right?

00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:22.580
Yeah.

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.000
Yeah.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.220
I can explain a little bit here.

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:29.940
It's what I used in this series was a so-called reflectance spectra of asteroids.

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:34.660
So imagine you have a flashlight and you flash the asteroid.

00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:38.620
You get a reflectance of the asteroid, of course, not a mirror or something, but you get something

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:38.960
back.

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:44.460
And based on the difference of your flashlight and what you get back, you can derive conclusions

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:46.600
about the chemical composition of the asteroid.

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:50.720
So there are like different spectra that encode different types.

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:54.840
And I use the spectra and this spectra are classified in certain classes.

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.340
Like some are, let's say, carbon rich.

00:54:57.340 --> 00:55:00.460
Some are, let's say, stony or iron rich.

00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:08.560
And I was thinking, well, we can use autoencoders to check the latent space and see if we can

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:11.780
see these different classes into a low dimensional space.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:16.740
So for all the viewers and listeners who don't know this autoencoder, it is like you have your

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:20.620
data and you make a regression model on your data itself.

00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:24.160
Like for example, a dog maps to a dog, a cat to a cat.

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:29.780
And in between in your neural network, you have like only a few attributes, only a few numbers.

00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:35.580
And these numbers, they are like encoded representation of your information, like the information of

00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:36.820
a cat or a dog.

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:39.680
The same thing you can do also with spectra of the asteroid.

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:45.580
And of course, I made a compression of, let's say, some spectra with 500 data points to two

00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:46.040
dimensions.

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:51.320
This is severe information loss, but I did it here, not for a science paper, but more for

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:52.500
visualization representation.

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:52.980
Yeah.

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:58.360
And I was able then to see, to show that these different classes that were, that are human

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:03.920
made, they are also underlined by a data scientific approach, by this autoencoder.

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:08.220
And this autoencoder does not know what is an S-class asteroid, what is C-class.

00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:10.360
It simply sees the spectra.

00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:17.120
And then with this different clusters, you see, okay, there is like intrinsic different information

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.360
in the spectra, right?

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.100
So this is pretty cool.

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:24.880
And to see, you can improve autoencoders with variational autoencoder and so on.

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:29.680
But this was the, let's say, very first approach I wanted to show to anybody who's interested

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:30.300
in this topic.

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:35.940
Maybe this opens the box just a little bit for people who want to go back and work with

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:41.480
some of that legacy data or hysterical data, historical data, where people maybe tried to

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:45.260
figure out these things, just hand it off to grad students and say, yeah, how bright do you

00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:45.980
think this is?

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:47.760
Is it more like that or more like this?

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:52.000
And then now you can apply these incredible machine learning models to it and maybe pull

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.460
out more nuanced details or find something new.

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:55.220
Yeah, exactly.

00:56:55.220 --> 00:57:00.200
So for example, we have also the data from the Cassini spacecraft from the Saturn mission.

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:03.560
And we have like hundreds, thousands of spectra there.

00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:09.440
And I'm doing currently some, yeah, in my freelance science job, some kind of classification task.

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:13.900
But at some point when we are finished with the project, I would like to make also this,

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:17.780
let's say, highly derived data also open, available to anybody, right?

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:20.100
And show, hey guys, these are the spectra.

00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:23.240
Use other methods to classify, to cluster the spectra.

00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:27.180
Because there are tons of ideas and I don't have all the time, right?

00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:32.620
So I want others to be enabled to work and continue on this heritage data because it's

00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:34.780
not boring just because it's old.

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:35.560
Yeah.

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:38.940
Now there's a lot of possibilities, I think, to start applying those things.

00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:42.620
Thomas, I think we might be out of time to go over any more of the videos.

00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:44.600
You have many, many more.

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:49.740
I definitely want to encourage people to go check out your channel and go through it.

00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:54.360
If they're really interested in actually diving into some interesting but pretty approachable

00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:55.520
science topics.

00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:57.200
You've got all the code there on GitHub.

00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.700
You walk through it without taking too many shortcuts.

00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.060
And oh, look, I changed it.

00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:03.200
Now it totally looks great.

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:04.420
You have no idea what I did, right?

00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:06.440
It's pretty much, you can follow along well there.

00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:07.780
So people should check that out.

00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:09.380
Obviously, links in the show notes, right?

00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:09.760
Yeah.

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:12.940
Thank you very much, Michael, for inviting me and to anybody.

00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:17.160
If you have any questions or would like to know more stuff, just approach me.

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:18.080
Just message me.

00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:21.240
I'm always open for ideas and feedback and I'm glad to help.

00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:22.840
So just reach out to me.

00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:23.500
Yeah, absolutely.

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.000
But you don't get out of here before I ask you the final two questions.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.380
If you're going to write some code, I think I know your answer from what you said already,

00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:31.080
but what editor are you using these days?

00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:34.180
Well, I'm using for my daily job VS Code, of course.

00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:35.420
It's very nice.

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:36.740
It's with remote containers.

00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:37.800
It's a game changer.

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:43.020
You can even develop Spark locally in a container, which is like really amazing, right?

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:47.720
I have to say, though, and I say this is a perfect time now to say goodbye to Atom.

00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:49.620
Atom was a very nice editor.

00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:50.880
I use it also for years.

00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:53.640
Now it's time to say goodbye to Atom.

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:59.020
And yeah, this is something I think we should address here in the podcast now.

00:58:59.020 --> 00:58:59.420
Yeah.

00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:04.760
Well, I feel like VS Code is a little bit like the next, the successor to Atom, right?

00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:07.600
Atom came from GitHub, Microsoft bought GitHub.

00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.300
They released Visual Studio Code.

00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:12.160
They're both in a similar style of an editor.

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:14.440
They're both, I think, electron apps.

00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:18.940
It feels like it's not so much as a goodbye as like a here's the next generation.

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:19.740
Yeah, exactly.

00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:21.240
It's a very good successor.

00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:22.960
So, of course, you're right.

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:25.960
It's a good times ahead, I think, with more and more plugins.

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:26.620
Yeah, cool.

00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:28.880
I'm sure the VS Code people send me a message like,

00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:30.000
that was not accurate enough.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.880
But no, conceptually, I think there was a lot of motivation that VS Code probably took

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:36.440
from Atom.

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:37.460
All right.

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:41.360
And then we've given a shout out to a couple of libraries like VizViz.

00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:45.360
What library or tool or whatever you come across that you're like,

00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:46.140
oh, this is really cool.

00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:47.340
I want to tell people about you.

00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:48.500
What thing you want to give a shout out to?

00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:50.480
I would like to give a shout out to AstroPy.

00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:56.220
And there's also a very huge Python library that contains astronomy information.

00:59:56.220 --> 01:00:00.580
You can extract data from astronomy databases and so on, apply methods and so on.

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:05.320
It is like, let's say, it's not like Spice, but let's say it's also quite complex.

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.100
So you have to dive into this, right?

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:10.440
But they're also open for contributions and so on.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:17.580
So if you are interested in joining astronomy science data, try out AstroPy and see if you

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:23.060
can improve it even because this is a huge community and everybody is grateful for ideas

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:23.780
and contributions.

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:27.220
So a very mighty library in the astronomy community.

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:28.100
Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:30.340
All right, Thomas, thank you for being here.

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.120
Final call to action.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.960
People are interested in this.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.720
You know, what do you tell them?

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.300
How do they get started?

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:37.140
Well, yeah, just sounds like a cliche.

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:38.160
Just be curious, right?

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.800
But yeah, I mean, astronomy is not only also about Python and so on.

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:46.860
If you just, if you want to approach it differently, start also with public outreach with more public

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:49.160
outreach related YouTube channels.

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:53.400
Also getting a telescope or something really do hands-on stuff.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.420
It's also quite nice.

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.560
You know, don't sit all the time in front of your computer.

01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:00.500
Just grab binoculars, just grab a camera and so on and do your own stuff.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.440
There's a lot of things.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:06.440
Remote telescopes are out there for a few bucks a night where you can do your own images.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.180
So yeah, it's not only about Python.

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:10.140
It's about Python.

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:11.300
I love Python, sure.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:16.200
But also I'd like to tell you guys to approach astronomy from different angles.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:21.280
Also sometimes going out, observe meteors, count them with your hands, and you can submit

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.880
this to some organization and everybody's grateful for that.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.360
Excellent.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:28.900
Well, we're all grateful for your YouTube work and putting that out there.

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:30.400
So thanks for all your contributions.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.620
Thanks, Michael, for having me.

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:32.020
You bet.

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:32.240
Bye.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:36.540

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.080
I really appreciate it.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.000
Now get out there and write some Python code.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:27.620
I'll see you next time.

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:57.600
Thank you.
