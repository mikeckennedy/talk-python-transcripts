00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.880
Web scraping is pulling the HTML of a website down and parsing useful data out of it.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.800
The use cases for this type of functionality are endless.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.840
Have a bunch of data on governmental sites that are only listed online in HTML without a download?

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.420
There's an API for that.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.160
Do you want to keep abreast of what your competitors are featuring on their site?

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.580
There's an API for that.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.140
Need alerts for changes on a website?

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.080
For example, enrollment is now open at your college,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.640
and you want to be first and avoid that 8 a.m. morning slot?

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.420
Well, there's an API for that as well.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.160
That API is Screen Scraping, and Attila Toth from Scraping Hub is here to tell us all about it.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.400
This is Talk Python To Me, episode 283, recorded July 22, 2020.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:57.940
Welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast on Python,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.980
the language, the libraries, the ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.920
This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.060
Follow me on Twitter, where I'm @mkennedy.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.800
Keep up with the show and listen to past episodes at talkpython.fm,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.240
and follow the show on Twitter via at Talk Python.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.020
This episode is brought to you by Linode and us.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.040
Python's async and parallel programming support is highly underrated.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.320
Have you shied away from the amazing new async and await keywords because you've heard it's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.460
way too complicated or that it's just not worth the effort?

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.060
With the right workloads, a hundred times speed up is totally possible with minor changes to your code.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.660
But you do need to understand the internals, and that's why our course,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.940
Async Techniques and Examples in Python,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.680
show you how to write async code successfully as well as how it works.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.620
Get started with async and await today with our course at talkpython.fm/async.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.640
Attila, welcome to Talk Python To Me.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.980
Thanks for having me, Michael.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.440
Yeah, it's great to have you here.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.240
I'm looking forward to talking about web scraping.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.120
It's the API that you didn't know it exists,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.980
but it's out there if you're willing to find it.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.920
It's like the dark API.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.740
Yeah, it's like a secret API that you need a little work

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.800
to sort of like be able to use it, to earn the right to use it.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.100
Yeah.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.460
But yeah, I like it.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.100
It's useful.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.120
It definitely is.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.460
And we've got some pretty interesting use cases to talk about

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.140
and a little bit of history and stuff.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.780
I'm obviously going to talk about Scrapey,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.060
some stuff about Scraping Hub, what you guys are doing there.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.000
So a lot of fun stuff.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.280
But before we get to all that, let's start with your story.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.560
How'd you get into programming in Python?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.400
Yeah, sure.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.420
So actually, I got into programming back in elementary school.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.800
I was the sort of kid, I think I was like eighth grade.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.260
And at the time, everybody in my class in school,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.420
everybody was asking for like,

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.280
I think it was Xbox 360 that just came out.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.540
Everybody was asking for that for Christmas.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.100
Yep.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.360
And I was the one who was asking for a book about programming.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.440
What language did you want at that time?

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.180
Yeah.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.320
So actually, I did like a lot of research.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.540
I think for like three months,

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.000
I was researching which programming language is the best for beginners.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.560
So I was on different forums, Yahoo Answers,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.600
in every place on the internet.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.360
And many people suggested at the time, Pascal.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.560
So I got this book.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.580
I think it was called something like

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.680
Introduction to Turbo Pascal or something like that.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.160
Right.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.600
Okay.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.100
Yeah.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.140
So I got the book.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.040
And that was the first step.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.320
And then after like 40 pages into the book,

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.760
I threw it away because I found that just Googling stuff,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.800
Googling stuff in Google and Stack Overflow,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.720
it's just easier to learn it that way.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.200
Nice.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.300
So did you end up writing anything in Turbo Pascal?

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.220
Yeah.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.580
I was just, you know,

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.940
the regular things beginners usually do.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.500
Like in the terminal,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.580
I, you know,

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.780
I printed my name in red.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.100
I printed like figures with characters,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.920
you know,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.880
just the regular things beginners do.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.740
But then I quickly switched to Java after Pascal.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.420
Right.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.400
Java, you can build web apps,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.160
you can build GUIs,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.780
more interesting things.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.500
Yeah.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.280
At the time I was interested in Android,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.440
Android development.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.060
Actually,

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.120
it was a few years later when I got to high school,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.920
I started to like program in Java to develop Android apps.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.180
I created like,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.580
I don't know,

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.020
maybe like five or six apps for Google Play that I just found useful,

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.160
like minor things like a music player that plays music randomly,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.880
which there are on your phone.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.160
And the only input is how long you want to listen to music.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.720
Oh, cool.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.680
So I was like,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.600
I want to listen for 20 minutes.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.420
And they just randomly plays music for 20 minutes.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.220
So, you know,

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.300
little things like that.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.740
Yeah.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.180
Cool.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.660
How'd you find your way over to Python?

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.700
Thanks to,

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.320
thanks to web scraping actually.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.920
Yeah.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.540
Yeah.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.080
You know,

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.580
I'm not sure which was the first point.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.040
No,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.220
I actually remember which was the first time I came across web scraping.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.920
I was trying to develop like a software.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.080
Like I was pretty into sports betting,

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.800
football and soccer.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.040
And I didn't play high stakes because I wasn't that good to afford to do it.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.420
But I was interested in the analysis part,

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.060
you know,

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.300
looking up stats,

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.900
looking up injury information,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.060
looking at different factors that would determine the result,

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.300
the outcomes of games.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:36.260
And I wanted to create a software that would predict the outcome of these games or some of the,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.860
we have,

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.200
I don't know,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.820
25 games in a weekend.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.000
And it would predict the like,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.460
okay,

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.640
look at these three games.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.760
And these are going to be the results.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.600
So I wanted to create a software like this.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.040
Right.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.460
And if that beats the spread that they are offering at Las Vegas,

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.800
you're like,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.980
oh,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.160
they're going to win by 14.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.460
Oh,

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.200
they said they're only winning by seven.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.280
I want to take that.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.620
Maybe.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.260
Yeah.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.160
I tried that.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.400
And I also tried.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.900
How did it go?

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.500
Yeah.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.880
Well,

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.520
the thing is,

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.760
I wouldn't say it went too good,

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.960
but it wasn't too bad.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.240
I mean,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.960
I experimented,

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.660
like,

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.040
first of all,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.700
I was betting on like over and under,

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.740
because I found that that's like a more predictable thing to bet on.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.020
That's what I thought,

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.120
because in reality,

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.940
it isn't,

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.820
but I bet on over and under.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.800
And so this software would tell me that,

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.120
hey,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.300
in this game,

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.760
you know,

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.400
if it's soccer,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.340
there will be more than two goals in the first half.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.320
And so what I would do is I would watch the game live,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.660
because in life,

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.820
there are better odds,

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.500
because as the time progresses,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.980
the odds for scoring the first half goes up.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.720
So I just waited for like the,

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.740
I think it was the 15th minutes or something like that.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.220
And if there is still no goals scored in the first half,

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.500
I would bet on it.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.660
So I was doing this for like,

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.220
I think four months without money,

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.620
just testing the system.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.120
Right.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.520
I was watching and okay,

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.120
I would bet right now.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.260
And I was calculating,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.120
I had this Excel spreadsheet and everything.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.380
And in that four months period,

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.520
I was just,

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.800
I think it was not profitable at all,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.020
but it was close to being just a little profitable long term.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.520
Yeah.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.060
Well,

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.340
maybe you were onto something.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.880
If you get some more factors,

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.600
maybe bring in a little machine learning,

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.480
who knows?

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.360
Yeah,

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.780
actually,

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.280
maybe I should pick it up.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.900
But that's when I came across web scraping.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.340
Right.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.260
Because I needed data.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.800
I needed stats.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.780
And a lot of these places,

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.220
they don't want to give out that data.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.540
They'll show it on their website,

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.980
but they're not going to make an API that you can just stream.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:41.300
Right.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.140
Exactly.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.340
At the time,

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:50.060
there were like different commercial APIs that big news corporations use,

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.960
but it was just a hobby project.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:59.080
And the only way for me to get data was to extract it from a publicly available website.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.220
And so I started to look into it.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.140
And at the time I was programming in Java.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.100
So I found Jsoup.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.860
I found HTML unit,

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.140
which is a testing library,

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.400
but it can be used for web scraping.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.500
I found,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.000
is it Jount?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.720
I think it's pronounced Jount.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.940
And I found other libraries.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.440
And everybody was saying that,

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.560
which one is the best?

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.320
Which one is the best?

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.460
Everybody was talking on the forums about Scrappy.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.240
And I didn't know what Scrappy was.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.700
So I looked it up.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.720
It's in Python.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.600
I don't know how to program in Python.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.880
I barely can program in Java.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.460
But then I eventually learned Python just to learn Scrappy.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.060
Cool.

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:40.680
Yeah.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.860
And it's such a nice way to do web scraping.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.580
It's a weird language.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.300
It's Python.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.740
It doesn't have semicolons,

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.500
curly braces.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.700
There's not so many of those.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.200
Yeah.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.960
It was like comparing it to Java.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.220
It's very clean.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:53.960
Yeah.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.720
That's for sure.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.200
Java is a little verbose in all of its type information,

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.860
even for a typed language,

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.680
like say compared to C or I don't know,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.620
maybe even C#.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.460
Like it likes its interfaces and all of its things and so on.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:06.660
Right.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.140
Yeah.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.020
The best thing I love about Python,

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.580
which I cannot do in Java,

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.840
is that in Python,

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.520
you can read the code like an actual sentence.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:15.980
Right.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.280
I mean,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:16.860
not always,

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.060
but sometimes you can,

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.060
it's like a sentence.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:19.500
Yeah.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:26.500
There's this cartoon joke about Python that there's these two scientists or something like that.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.000
And they've got this pseudocode.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.740
It says pseudocode on their file.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.820
And it's like pseudocode.txt.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.580
They're like,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:32.780
oh,

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.020
how do we turn this into a program?

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:34.420
Oh,

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.820
you change the txt to a .py and it'll run.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:37.340
Yeah.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.460
It's already there.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.280
Yeah,

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:39.620
exactly.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.280
All right.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:40.520
Well,

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.020
so that's how you got into it.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.200
And obviously your interest in web scraping.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:44.720
So,

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.060
you've continued that interest today,

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:47.440
right?

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.300
What are you doing these days?

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:48.940
Yeah.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.440
So I've been developing like a lot of spiders,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.920
a lot of scrapers with Scrappy and other tools over the years.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.220
And nowadays I joined the company who actually created Scrappy,

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.020
Scraping Hub.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.180
And I'm with Scraping Hub for over a year now.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:09.340
And what I'm doing is as a day-to-day is educating people about web scraping,

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.840
both on the technical side of things and business side of things,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.240
like how to extract data from the web,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.420
why is it useful for you or why it can be useful for you.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:25.520
And so nowadays I don't really code that much unless it's for

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.620
an article or a tutorial or to showcase some new stuff.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.360
I spend more time on creating videos and just,

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:33.760
you know,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.220
teaching.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:34.780
Yeah.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:35.040
Well,

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:35.840
that sounds really fun.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.760
You just get to explore,

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.020
right?

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:37.700
Yeah.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:42.060
And the biggest part or the best part I love about it is that like,

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:47.540
I get to speak to customers who are doing web scraping or who are sort of

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.280
enjoying the benefits of web scraping.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.020
And there are some really cool stories,

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.720
like what these customers do with data.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.180
Yeah.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.780
And it's really creative.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.080
Like people can get super creative,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.660
like how to make use of,

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.120
you know,

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.760
web data,

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:03.800
which is like,

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.060
it's in front of you.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.700
You can see the data on your website.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.320
It doesn't look like interesting or like,

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:09.680
you know,

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.660
but when you extract it and you structure it,

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.380
you can actually make use of it and drive,

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:15.980
you know,

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.300
you can do many different things,

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.000
but you can drive better decisions in companies,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.720
which is pretty exciting.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.360
Yeah.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.820
And I guess if you work at a company and you're looking to think about,

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:31.660
I'd like to do some comparative analysis against say our competitors and what

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:32.200
are they doing?

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.880
What are they doing with sales?

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.220
Like in terms of discounts,

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.360
what are they doing in terms of things are featuring,

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.060
right?

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:42.760
You could theoretically write a web scraper that looks at your competitors'

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.620
data,

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.180
their sites,

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:44.840
their presentation,

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.220
and sort of gives you that over time relative to you,

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:48.580
right?

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:49.760
Or something like that.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.320
Yeah.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.180
Like many use cases are,

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:54.780
you know,

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:59.700
as you said about monitoring competitors or monitoring the market.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:06.980
And especially it's a big thing in e-commerce where most of the sectors in e-commerce are

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.340
really like,

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.640
there are a lot of companies doing the same thing,

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.100
selling the same thing.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.620
And it's just really hard for them to sell more products.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.300
So with web scraping,

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.300
they can monitor the competitor prices.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.880
They can monitor the competitors' stock information.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.980
They can monitor pretty much everything that is on their website,

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.220
publicly available.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.820
And they can gather this information.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:34.720
And,

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.020
you know,

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.120
it can be like tens of thousands of products or more.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.840
And you can see where you should raise your prices,

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.980
lower your prices,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:49.440
and how to price your products better and do marketing better.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.180
Yeah.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.880
And there's a lot of implicit signals as well that are not,

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:53.360
you know,

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.940
they're not most companies.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:55.380
Some do,

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.280
but most won't go,

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.580
there are 720 of these sold today or whatever.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.140
Yeah.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.720
but you could say graph,

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.040
like the number of reviews over time or the number of stars over time,

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.360
things like that would give you a sense of like a proxy,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.560
that kind of information.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:10.760
Right.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.660
you could come up with a pretty good analysis and pretty interesting analysis.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:18.700

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.660
Oh, and one last thing,

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.460
they're hiring.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.520
Go to linode.com slash careers,

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.540
to find out more.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:12.860
Let them know that we sent you.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.560
also, like, some of the things that people monitor with web scraping

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.540
is more like higher level.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.360
We have the price, stock,

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.040
but those are, like, really specific things,

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.300
or values.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.640
But with web scraping,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.300
you can actually monitor, like,

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.880
company behaviors,

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.500
what the company is doing on a high level.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.140
And you can achieve this by monitoring news,

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.200
looking for, like,

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.480
the text,

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.540
or the blog of the company,

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:45.420
and getting out some useful information from that.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.440
And, you know, setting up alerts and things like that.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.740
Yeah, yeah, super cool.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.560
So there's a couple of examples that I wanted to

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.620
put out there,

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.200
and then get your thought on it.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.000
One is, you know,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.220
most of the world has been through the ringer on COVID-19

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.560
and all of this stuff.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.420
In the U.S.,

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.180
we definitely have been recently getting our fair share of

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.900
disruption from that.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.560
So there's an article on

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.940
towardsdatascience.com

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.100
where some,

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.440
the challenge was that

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.160
in the early days of the lockdowns,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.340
at least in the United States,

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.080
we had things like Instacart

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.980
and other grocery delivery things,

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.660
like there's local grocery stores,

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.020
you could order stuff

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.320
and they would bring it to your car outside

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.900
so you didn't have to go in,

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.540
other people,

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.580
fewer people in the store,

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.420
all sorts of stuff

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.740
that was probably a benefit from that.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.220
But if you tried to book it,

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.060
it was like a week and a half out.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:34.600
Yeah.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.480
And it was,

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.560
it was a mess, right?

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.540
And so this person,

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.580
as they wrote it,

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.460
Emmy GIL wrote this article

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.220
that talked about using web scraping

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:48.100
to find a grocery store delivery slots, right?

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.140
So you could basically say,

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.540
I'm going to go to my grocery store

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.600
or to like something like,

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.120
Instacart

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.580
and I'm just going to watch

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.480
until one of these slots opens up.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.000
And then what he had to do

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.140
was actually send him a text,

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.760
like go now and book it,

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.140
place my order now or whatever.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.020
And I think that that's a really creative way

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.420
of using web scraping.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.440
What do you think?

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.720
Yeah, it's definitely really creative.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.500
It's useful.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.200
So he wasn't just only getting alerted

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.920
when there's a new spot available,

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.540
but he actually created the bot.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.360
So it like,

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.900
it chooses that spot.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.380
Right.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.680
It would actually place the order.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:21.940
Yeah, that's smart.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:22.560
I mean, there are,

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.100
we had the same situation in Hungary

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.160
where you couldn't find any free spot.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.700
And the thing I love about web scraping

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.760
is that it can be useful

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.860
for huge companies

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.060
to do web scraping at scale,

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.540
but it can be also useful

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.400
for literally everyone.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:40.780
Yeah.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:41.580
In the world,

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.400
just doing little things like this.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.400
I have a friend who is looking

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.560
to buy an apartment

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.100
and currently the real estate market

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.640
is really like fragile,

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.640
I would say.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.180
Yeah, yeah.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:52.740
Yeah.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.940
And what he wants to do

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.540
that I suggested him to do it

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:57.500
is to create,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.560
set up a bot

00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.960
that monitors

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.740
like 10 websites,

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.800
10 real estate listing websites.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.980
And so he will get alerted

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.560
when there is a apartment available

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.020
with the attributes

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.480
he's interested in.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.300
Right.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:13.680
Okay.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.220
That's awesome.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:14.800
Yeah.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.120
So there are so many

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.560
little things like this

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.260
in web scraping

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.720
and it's just awesome.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:21.700
Yeah, I agree.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.160
People talk often

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.140
about this concept

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.840
popularized by Al Swigert,

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.280
like automate the boring stuff.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.100
Like, oh, I got to always

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.100
do this thing in Excel.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.020
So could I write a script

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:30.740
that just generates

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.020
the Excel workbook

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.160
or I've always got to

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.080
do this other thing,

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:34.900
copy these files

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:35.660
and rename them,

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.660
write something that does that.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:37.820
But this feels like

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.120
the automate the boring stuff

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.840
of web interfaces,

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.920
automate tracking

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.760
of these sites

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.420
and let it like finding out

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.240
when there's a new thing.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:45.780
Yeah.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:46.820
Automate the boring stuff

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.540
is a really good resource.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.440
In this case,

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.480
it's really like

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.480
what it's about.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.400
If you didn't create

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.000
a web scraper for this,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.120
what you would do?

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.120
You would probably

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.660
look at the website

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.660
every single,

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.300
as often as you can,

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:00.820
every day,

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.860
every hour.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.060
You'd hear somebody say,

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.300
I checked it every day

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:04.960
until I found

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.880
the apartment I wanted,

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.360
right?

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.280
That's what they would say.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.380
Yeah, exactly.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.420
Yeah.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.540
And what you don't hear

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:11.660
them say so often is

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.280
my bot alerted me

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.420
when my dream apartment

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.080
was available.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:15.760
Yeah.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.320
I created a scrappy spider

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.140
that alerts me

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.140
when there is a new

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.500
apartment listing

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.380
in that area.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:21.960
Yeah.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:22.640
And,

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.100
but I think it's a really

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:24.700
great example

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.500
and it's like,

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.600
there's so many things

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.440
on your computer

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.140
that you do

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:28.960
that you kind of feel like,

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.160
ah,

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.080
this stuff I just got to do.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:30.880
But on the web,

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.960
there's way more

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.280
even that you probably end up,

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.200
I always go to this site

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:34.940
and then I do this thing

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:35.600
and I got to do that,

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:35.820
right?

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:36.540
And web scraping

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.680
will kind of open

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.220
up a ton of that stuff.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:39.860
So,

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.180
let me give you two examples.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.240
One,

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.420
really grand,

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.200
large scale.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:44.700
One,

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.000
like,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.980
extremely small

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:46.420
but like,

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.480
really interesting to me

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.080
in the next,

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:48.540
you know,

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:48.900
hour.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:49.440
So,

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.580
grand scale first.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.120
When Trump was elected

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.060
in the United States

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.180
2015

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.800
and he was going to be

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.520
come president

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.420
in 2016,

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.980
there was a lot of concern

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.140
about what was going to happen

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.080
to some of the data

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.380
that had so far

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:02.980
been hosted

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.000
on places like

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.020
whitehouse.gov.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:05.480
So,

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:05.700
like,

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.160
there's a lot of

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.100
climate change data

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.160
hosted there

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.180
from the scientists

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.320
and there was

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.220
a thought

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.180
that he might

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.060
take that down,

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.940
not necessarily destroy it,

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.500
but definitely

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.280
take it down

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.580
publicly from the site

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.040
and there's,

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.380
you know,

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:18.940
there's all these

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:19.800
different places,

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.800
the CDC

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.960
and other

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.920
organizations

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.560
that have a bunch

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:23.960
of data

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:24.940
that a bunch

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:25.840
of data scientists

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.660
and other folks

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.820
were just worried

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:29.160
about.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:29.720
So,

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.260
there were these

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:30.980
big movements

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.740
and I struggle

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.060
to find the articles,

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:33.580
you know,

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:34.580
almost four years

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.200
out now.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.220
Can't quite find

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:36.880
the right search term

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.440
to pull them up

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.340
but there was these

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:38.920
like,

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.120
save the data

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.940
hackathon type things.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:42.160
So,

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.060
people got together

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.640
at different universities,

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.000
like 20,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.800
30 people

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.440
and they would spend

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.000
the weekend

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.380
writing web scraping

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.160
to go around

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:50.640
to all these

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.640
different organizations,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.220
download the data.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.180
I think they were

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.520
coordinated across locations

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.700
and then they would

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:57.440
put that all

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.280
in a central location,

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.060
I think somewhere

00:19:59.060 --> 00:19:59.520
in Europe,

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.240
like in Switzerland

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:00.760
or something,

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.500
so the data

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.560
could live on.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.420
And I think

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.180
the day that

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:04.820
Trump was elected,

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:05.660
I think the

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.540
climate change data

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.120
went off of

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:07.800
whitehouse.gov.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.340
So,

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.080
at least one

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:09.740
of the data sources

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:10.580
did disappear

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.800
and that's

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:12.700
a pretty large

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:13.580
scale web scraping

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:13.920
effort.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.560
Some of it was

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.120
just like download

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:15.740
CSVs,

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.280
but a lot of it

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:16.900
was web scraping,

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:17.300
I think.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:17.880
Yeah,

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.000
like the thing

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.040
is people say

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:20.800
that once

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.820
you put something

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:22.480
on the internet,

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.100
it's going to

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:23.800
stay there forever.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.980
And why

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:25.760
this story is

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.760
interesting is that

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.860
this is information

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.060
that is useful

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.320
for everyone.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:30.740
Yeah.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:31.660
And this is the

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:32.440
kind of information

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.600
that you want

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.760
to make publicly

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.300
available.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.440
And I think

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.100
this is one of

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:37.920
the things that

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.920
this movement

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:39.500
is about,

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:40.300
if I can call

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:40.720
it movement,

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.920
open data

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.500
to make data

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.740
open and accessible

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.560
for everyone.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.140
And web scraping

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.680
is really

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.000
a great tool

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.900
to do that,

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.480
to extract data

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.300
from the web,

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.000
put it in a

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
structured format

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.100
in a database

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.080
so you can use it,

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.300
can just store

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.300
information or you

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.560
can get some

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.400
kind of intelligence

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.300
from the data.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.820
And it's really

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:05.440
like without

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.120
web scraping,

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.400
what you couldn't

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.220
do anything else.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.240
will you just

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:09.860
copy-paste

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.480
the whole thing

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.460
or what will

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:11.760
you do?

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:12.560
It would take

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.500
a lot of

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.480
by-hand work.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:14.720
Yeah,

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.360
it wouldn't be good.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:15.860
Yeah.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:16.460
Yeah,

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:16.960
so that's really

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.260
cool.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.000
And that was

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:18.640
an interesting

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.820
large scale,

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:20.080
like,

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.200
hey,

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:20.520
we have to

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.080
organize.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:21.740
We've got

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:22.160
one month

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:22.600
to do it.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.140
Let's make

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:23.520
this happen.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.380
So on a

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:24.980
much smaller

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:25.400
scale,

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.300
I recently

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.220
decided to

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:27.760
realize that

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.480
some of my

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.200
pages on my

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:29.920
site were

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.660
getting indexed

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:31.160
by Google,

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.000
not because

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.660
anything on the

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.100
internet was

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:33.780
linking to them

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.260
publicly,

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.480
but something

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.140
would be in

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:36.980
Gmail or

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:37.420
somebody would

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.160
write it down

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:38.720
and then Google

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.500
would find it.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.660
So I just went

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:41.260
through and put a

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.180
bunch of no index

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.440
meta tags on a

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:43.940
bunch of my

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.620
parts of my

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:44.880
site.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.580
But it really

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.260
scared me because

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:46.920
I changed a

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.380
whole bunch of

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:47.800
it and I'm

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.300
pretty sure I

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:48.880
got it right.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.040
But what if I

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:50.740
accidentally put

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:51.880
no index on

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.680
some of my

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.900
course pages

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:54.580
that advertise

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.540
them and all

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.080
of a sudden the

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.140
traffic goes from

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:57.820
whatever it is

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:58.620
to literally

00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.540
zero because I

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:00.480
accidentally told

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.680
all the search

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:01.960
engines,

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.140
please don't tell

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:03.580
anyone about

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:04.040
this page.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:05.080
what I was

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:05.640
doing actually

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.180
right before we

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:06.860
called unrelated

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:07.580
to the fact that

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:08.000
this was the

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.680
topic was I

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.020
was going to

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:09.720
write a very

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.480
simple web

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.240
scrappy thing

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:11.780
that goes and

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.300
grabs my

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:12.880
site map,

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.600
hits every

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.500
single page and

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.240
just tells me

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:15.960
the pages that

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.920
are not indexed

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.820
just for me to

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:18.340
double check.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.000
But you know,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:19.500
that template

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.340
didn't get reused

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:20.940
somewhere where I

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:21.440
didn't think it

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.260
got reused,

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:22.540
you know,

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:22.960
like the little

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.600
shared bit that

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.640
has the head

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.340
in it and so

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:25.480
on.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:25.880
Yeah,

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.340
it's sort of

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.860
like in SEO,

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:28.500
like search engine

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:28.980
optimization,

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:29.780
we have this

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:30.100
thing,

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.580
technical SEO.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:32.000
Yeah.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
And actually,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.540
it's another

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.360
use case for

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.280
web scraping or

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:35.960
like crawling,

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.460
where you want

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.000
to crawl your

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.980
own website,

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:41.700
just as you

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:41.800
know,

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.980
you did and

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:43.620
to learn the

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.980
site map or

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.880
to find pages

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:47.660
where you don't

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:48.580
have proper SEO

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:49.060
optimization,

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:49.960
like you don't

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.400
have meta

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.200
description on

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:51.920
some pages,

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.080
you have

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.440
multiple like

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.640
H1 tags or

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.000
whatever.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.560
Right.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.480
and with

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:57.940
crawling,

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.800
you can figure

00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.280
these out.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.320
And I just

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.220
remember the

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:01.840
story from

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.680
like 2016,

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.420
where web

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.080
scraping was

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.460
used to

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.460
reveal lobbying

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.220
and corruption

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:10.800
in Peru.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.280
Oh,

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:11.620
wow.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:12.080
Okay.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:12.780
Yeah,

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:13.900
I'm not 100%

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:14.120
sure,

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:14.480
but I think

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.120
it was related

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.160
to, you

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:16.240
know,

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:16.640
the Panama

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.300
Papers.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.400
Yeah,

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.420
I was going

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:19.860
to guess it

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:20.240
might have

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:20.600
something to

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:20.900
do with the

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:21.140
Panama

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:21.540
Papers,

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.060
which was

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:22.940
really interesting

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:23.460
in and of

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:23.820
itself.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:24.100
Yeah,

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:24.800
yeah,

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.380
and they

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:25.840
actually,

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.620
they use

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.400
many tools

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.440
to scrape

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:28.860
the web,

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:29.700
but they

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.120
also use

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:30.880
Scrappy to

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.600
get like

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.600
information from

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.060
these,

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:33.760
I guess,

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.200
government

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.640
websites or

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.840
other websites.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.120
But yeah,

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:38.600
like it's

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.640
crazy that a

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.120
web scraping

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:40.840
can reveal

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.040
these kinds

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:42.740
of really,

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:43.480
this is a

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.020
big thing.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:44.440
Yeah.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.380
Corruption

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.040
and web

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.860
scraping can

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:47.660
tell you

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:47.900
that,

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:48.260
hey,

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:48.980
there is

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:49.580
something wrong

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:49.860
here,

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:50.260
you should

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:50.960
pay attention.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:51.800
It lets you

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.600
automate the

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.380
discovery and

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:53.760
the linking

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.280
of all this

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:54.880
different data

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.860
that was never

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:56.620
intended to be

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:57.180
put together,

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:57.620
right?

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:57.980
There's no

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.680
API that's

00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:58.980
supposed to

00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.560
take like

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.740
these donations,

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.220
this investment,

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.360
this other

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.540
construction deal,

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.060
or whatever the

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:05.640
heck it was,

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.280
and like link

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:06.880
them together.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.380
But with

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:07.880
web scraping,

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.960
you can sort

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.360
of pull it

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:09.540
off,

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:09.760
right?

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.180
Yeah,

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:10.540
you can

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:11.420
structure the

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:11.940
whole web.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.500
I mean,

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:12.920
technically,

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.420
you could

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.360
structure the

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:14.900
whole web,

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.520
or you could

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.620
get like a

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:17.960
set of

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.900
websites that

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.720
are considered

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.820
or that has

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:21.580
the same kind

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:22.700
of data you

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:23.060
are looking

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:23.440
for,

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:23.960
like you

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.240
can be

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:24.880
e-commerce,

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.160
fintech,

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.220
real estate,

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:27.620
whatever.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.800
You can grab

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.580
those sites,

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.560
extract the

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:30.900
data,

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.460
the publicly

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.140
available data,

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.040
structure it,

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.180
and then you

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:34.720
can do many

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.160
sorts of

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:35.420
things.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:35.940
You can do

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:36.660
like NLP,

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:37.480
you can just

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.240
search in the

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:38.600
data,

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.360
you can do

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:39.920
many different

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:40.920
kinds of

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.260
things.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:41.740
Yeah,

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.540
that's cool.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:43.800
So let's talk

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.280
a little bit

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.520
specifically about

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.820
Scrappy and

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.860
maybe Scraping Hub

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:48.440
as well,

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:48.860
and some of the

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:49.700
more general

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:50.460
challenges you

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:50.960
might run into

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.680
with web scraping.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.580
So right on

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.260
the Scrappy

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:53.820
website,

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.680
homepage,

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.740
project site,

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:56.520
there's a

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.320
real simple

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:57.900
example that

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.200
says here's

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:58.640
why you should

00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:58.920
use it.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.260
You can just

00:24:59.260 --> 00:24:59.700
create this

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:00.080
class,

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:00.500
it derives

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.080
from Scrappy.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:01.560
spider,

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.420
and you

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:02.700
give it

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:03.200
some URLs,

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:03.680
and it

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.100
has this

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:04.500
parse

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.300
function,

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:05.740
and off

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:06.160
it goes.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:06.640
Do you

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:06.840
want to

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.200
talk to us

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.600
real quickly

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.080
about what

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:08.540
it's like

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:08.980
to write

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:09.960
code to do

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:10.460
web scraping

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:11.060
with this

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:11.400
API?

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.180
With Scrappy?

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:12.680
Yeah.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.400
Yeah,

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.420
so with

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.020
Scrappy,

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.100
if you use

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:16.520
Scrappy,

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.200
what you really

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.380
get is like a

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.060
full-fledged

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.560
web crawling

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.200
framework,

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.000
or like a

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:22.420
web scraping

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:22.920
framework.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.120
So it really

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.100
makes it easy

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.340
for you to

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:27.080
extract data

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:27.820
from any

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:28.300
website.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.380
And it

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:29.720
has,

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.380
there are other

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.280
libraries like

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.220
BeautifulSoup,

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.420
or LXML,

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:34.740
or in Java,

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:35.660
we have JSUP,

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.660
that are only

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.640
focused around

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.920
parsing HTML

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.740
and getting,

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.540
or getting data

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.760
from HTML and

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.680
XML files.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:43.280
Right,

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.200
BeautifulSoup is

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:44.960
I have the

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.380
text,

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.000
I have the

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
HTML source,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:47.760
now tell me

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.380
stuff about it,

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:48.580
right?

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:49.220
Right.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.020
That's sort of

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:50.520
its whole job,

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:50.700
yeah.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.340
Right,

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.400
but Scrappy,

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.220
I would say

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.020
it's like maybe

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.100
10% of the

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:55.980
whole picture

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:56.680
or the big

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.060
picture,

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:57.920
because with

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.460
Scrappy,

00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.000
like,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:25:59.200
yeah,

00:25:59.200 --> 00:25:59.760
you can parse

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.360
the HTML,

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.760
but in

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.480
real-world

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.040
project,

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.500
that's not the

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.300
only task you

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:05.880
need to do.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880
In real-world

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.300
project,

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.880
you need to

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.800
process the data

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.320
as well.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.380
You need to

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.300
structure the

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.020
data properly,

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.480
you need to

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.460
maybe put it

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.220
into a database,

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.380
maybe export it

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.080
as a CSV file

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:20.700
or JSON,

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.900
you need to

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:22.740
clean the data,

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:23.340
you need to

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:23.980
normalize the

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:24.300
data.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.300
In real-world

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:25.720
scenarios,

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.200
you need to

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:26.660
do a lot of

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.080
things,

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:27.560
not just

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.240
scraping the

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:28.500
data,

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:29.940
and Scrappy

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:30.740
really makes

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.780
it easy to

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:32.840
develop these

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.400
spiders that

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:34.980
grab the

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:35.320
data,

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.440
and then

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.420
right there in

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:37.900
Scrappy,

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:38.980
you can clean

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:39.200
it,

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.040
you can process

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:40.460
it,

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.700
and when the

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:42.460
data leaves

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:43.180
Scrappy,

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.320
it's usable

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.520
for whatever

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.040
you want to

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:46.600
use it for.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:46.960
Right,

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.460
maybe you get

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.840
a list or

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.920
sequence of

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.860
dictionaries that

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:51.560
have the pieces

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.160
of data that

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.160
you went after

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:53.700
or something like

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:53.880
that.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.380
Yeah,

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:54.680
right.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.240
So that's why

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:56.960
I really like

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.340
Scrappy,

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.160
but also I think

00:26:59.160 --> 00:26:59.740
it's the best

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:00.600
framework to

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.500
maintain your

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:01.940
spiders,

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.200
because a big

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:03.940
problem in

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:04.480
web scraping

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.540
is that once

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.740
you write the

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:07.080
spider,

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.180
it works,

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:08.640
you get the

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:08.940
data,

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:09.900
it will

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:10.620
probably not

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.640
work in

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.080
the six

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:12.420
months in

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:12.940
the future

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:13.720
because the

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.660
website changes

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.040
or layout

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:16.980
changes.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:17.880
They've decided

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.440
to switch

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.040
JavaScript

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:19.780
front-end

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.760
frameworks or

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.740
redesign the

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.600
navigation or

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:22.800
something,

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.060
right?

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:23.760
Exactly.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.980
And so you

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:25.820
need to adjust

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:26.420
your code,

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.160
adjust your

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.120
selectors,

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.240
you need to

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.240
maybe adjust

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:30.600
the whole

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.220
processing

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.980
part of

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:33.520
Scrappy,

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.680
because maybe

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.360
in the past

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.640
you were able

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.920
to extract

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.560
only messy

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.120
code from

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:39.680
the HTML,

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.900
but they did

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:41.480
some changes

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.200
on the website.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:42.780
Now it's

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.180
clean,

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:43.780
you don't need

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:44.340
so much

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:44.840
processing.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.180
And with

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:46.640
Scrappy,

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.420
it's really

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.000
easy to

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:48.640
maintain the

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:48.980
code,

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:49.700
which is,

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:49.940
you know,

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:50.260
it's really

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:50.960
important if

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.780
you rely on

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:52.520
web-extracted

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:53.120
data on a

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:53.820
daily basis,

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:54.660
you need to

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.080
maintain the

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:55.320
code.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:55.740
Yeah,

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:56.280
really neat.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.600
So to me,

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.000
when I look

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.740
at this simple

00:27:58.740 --> 00:27:59.500
API here,

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.600
it's like you

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.240
create a class,

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.060
you give it a

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:02.920
set of start

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.440
URLs,

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.100
and there's a

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:04.760
parse function,

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.160
and that

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:05.700
comes in,

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:06.580
you run some

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:07.660
CSS selectors on

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.100
what you get.

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.040
For each thing

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:09.640
that you find,

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.300
you can yield

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.300
that back as

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:11.980
part of the

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:12.640
thing, like the

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.480
result you found,

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.060
and then you

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.120
can follow the

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:15.560
next one.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.160
I think that's

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:16.600
probably the

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.940
biggest differentiator

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:18.780
from what I can

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:19.360
tell is,

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.440
it's like as

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.120
you're parsing

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:21.860
it, you're

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:22.780
directing it to

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.640
go do more

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.180
discovery, maybe

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.160
on linked pages

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:26.740
and things like

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:27.000
that.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.520
Yeah, like on

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.460
websites where

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.760
you need to go

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:31.980
deeper, maybe

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.320
because, you

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:33.800
know, you need to

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.660
go deeper in the

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.040
sitemap or you

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:36.620
need to like

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.900
paginate, you

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.560
need to do more

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.820
requests to get

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:41.400
the data.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:41.960
Yeah.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.000
In tools like

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:43.980
BeautifulSoup, you

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.060
would need to

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.360
sort of create your

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.500
own logic or like,

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.300
you know, how you

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.020
want to do that.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.820
But in Scrappy, it's

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:51.640
already sort of

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.220
straightforward how

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:53.820
you want to do

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:54.560
that or how you

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:55.180
can do that.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.180
And you just need

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.240
to just click this

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.080
button, click this

00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:58.840
button, and you

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.360
paginate with

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.300
Scrappy because you

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.760
have this high-level

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.080
functions and

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.360
methods that let

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.200
you paginate and

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.700
let you do things

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:08.800
in a chain, you

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:08.940
know?

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:09.360
Yeah.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.280
Yeah, very cool

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:10.520
API.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.520
So let's talk about

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.080
some of the

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.840
challenges you might

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.040
get.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.060
I mean, probably to

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:15.560
me, the biggest

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.320
challenge, well,

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.780
there's two problems

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:18.720
that I would say, the

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.300
two biggest

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:19.840
challenges.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.760
One is probably

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.380
maybe generally you

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.160
could call it data

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.100
quality, but more

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.640
specifically like the

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.680
structure changed,

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.200
right?

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:28.980
they've added a

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:29.680
column to this

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.900
table and it's not

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:31.580
what I thought it

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.100
was anymore.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.540
Like it used to be

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.380
temperature and now

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.320
it's pressure because

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.100
they've added that

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.260
column and I wrote it

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.200
to have three columns

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:38.960
in the table, now it's

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:39.380
got four.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.300
The other one is I go

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.140
and I get the source

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.460
code of the page and

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.020
it says, you know,

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.880
view.application or

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.080
there's like an

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.300
Angular app or

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.640
something and you get

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.560
just a bunch of

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:52.680
script tags that

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.660
have no data in

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.820
them because it's not

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:55.760
actually executed yet.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.420
Yeah, I mean, this

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.620
is like really all

00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.720
the things that all

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.660
the reasons why you

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.520
need to maintain the

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.600
code, which can be,

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.540
you know, it takes

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.040
time to maintain the

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:05.360
code.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.680
Actually, that's why

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.460
there are more

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.160
advancing machine

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.140
learning technologies

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:12.780
that pretty much

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.460
maintain the code

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.160
for you.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:15.780
Oh, wow.

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:15.960
Okay.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.760
Give us an example

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.260
of that.

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.360
Like find me the

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.420
title or find me the

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.240
stock price off of

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.360
this page, machine

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:21.700
magic.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.320
Yeah.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.220
So actually it's

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.160
not that big of a

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:24.480
magic.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.840
Like in the future,

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.340
you won't need to

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:28.960
write things like

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.680
selectors.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.800
You don't need to

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.120
tell Scrappy or

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:32.980
like, you know,

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:33.660
whatever tool you

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.440
use to, hey, this

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.380
is the price title,

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.380
whatever.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.820
I want to extract

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:39.980
it.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.020
This is the selector

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.320
where you can find it

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.120
in the HTML.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.440
In the future, you

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.940
will not need to do

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:46.200
that.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.660
In the future, what

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.240
you will only need to

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.820
say is that this is

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:51.440
the page.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.780
this is real estate

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.580
listing or this is a

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.240
product page or this

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.800
is some kind of

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.140
financial page.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:00.540
So you just need to

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.940
say the data type.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:02.400
Yeah.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.520
And then the machine

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.120
will know what

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.700
fields to look for.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.120
So it will know that

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.360
if it's a product page,

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.240
you probably need

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.020
like price.

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:13.960
You probably need

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.460
product title or

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:16.160
like product name,

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.480
sorry, description,

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.060
stock information,

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.320
maybe reviews, if

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:20.800
any.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.920
So in the future,

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:22.800
you just need to

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.120
specify the data type

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.500
and you will get all

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.440
the data fields that

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.060
you want with ML.

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:28.600
Yeah.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.660
That's like a dream.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.080
Well, it's sort of

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.420
like it's a reality in

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.880
some cases because

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:34.580
like, you know, there

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:35.560
are many, there are

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.980
some products out

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.240
there that do this

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.300
at Scraping Hub.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.960
We have like, for

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.980
example, news API,

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.340
which does exactly

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.520
this thing for

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.720
articles and news.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.260
Okay.

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:46.940
Yeah.

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:47.920
So what you do is

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.700
that, hey, this is

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.500
the page URL.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:50.800
give me everything

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.060
and you get the

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.500
article title, you

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.240
get the text body,

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.980
you get, you know,

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:57.720
everything that is on

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.160
the page.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.380
Well, and if any

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.180
place is going to

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.740
have enough data on

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.960
scraping to like

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:03.940
answer those kinds of

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:04.540
questions more

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:05.520
generally, it sounds

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.320
like you guys might.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.680
You guys do so much

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.540
web scraping, right?

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.920
That like way more

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.940
than a lot of people

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.380
in terms of as a

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:12.700
platform.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.200
I don't know how

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.660
you like share that

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:15.460
across projects.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.360
I don't think that,

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.120
I don't see a good

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:17.720
way to do that, but

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.680
it seems like you

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.280
should be in a

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.400
position that somehow

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.540
you could build some

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:22.400
cool tools around all

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:22.620
that.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.460
Yeah, we do a lot of

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:25.380
web scraping, as you

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:25.620
said.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.500
And it's really about

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:28.860
the biggest problem is

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:30.540
that there is no one

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.480
schema that websites

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.860
follow when it comes

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:34.380
to data.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.000
So when you scrape,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.220
you need to like

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.560
figure out a structure

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.640
that would work for

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.580
all the websites.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.860
and then you extract,

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:44.600
you sort of like

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.980
standardize the data.

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.960
And that's why the

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:47.940
data type is important

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:48.660
to specify.

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:49.380
Right.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.600
What about JavaScript?

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.580
That's all the cool

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.860
kids say they should,

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:54.780
you don't write server

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:55.600
code anymore.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.380
You don't write

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:56.940
templates.

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:58.500
Just you write just

00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.700
APIs and you talk to

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:00.680
them with HTML and

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:00.980
JavaScript.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:01.720
But that doesn't

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.320
scrape very well.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:02.940
I'm not sure that's

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:03.460
necessarily what you

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:03.880
should be doing,

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.860
but entirely, but a

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:06.540
lot of people are and

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:07.240
it makes web scraping

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.340
definitely more

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:08.700
challenging.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:09.400
Yeah.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.360
Like nowadays,

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.360
all the websites

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.580
have some kind of

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:13.780
JavaScript running.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:16.180
And if the data you

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.340
need to extract is

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:18.540
rendered with

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.920
JavaScript, that can

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.220
be a challenge.

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:22.860
And first, if you're

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:23.920
writing a spider,

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.280
first, you should

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.520
look for ways to get

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.580
the data without

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.700
executing JavaScript.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.140
You can do this

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.120
sort of, you know,

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.200
I call them hidden

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.000
APIs when there is

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.660
no documented API

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:36.680
for the website.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.040
But if you look in

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.040
the background,

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.000
background, that is

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.100
actually a public

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.080
API available.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:42.660
Right.

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:43.860
So it's clearly going

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:44.840
back, like if you've

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.640
got a Vue.js front

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.420
end, it's probably

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.920
calling some function

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.760
that's returning like a

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.200
JSON result of the

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:52.860
data you actually

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:53.200
want.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.220
You just got to look

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:54.940
in your web browser

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.860
tools to see that

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:56.440
happening, right?

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.480
Yeah, exactly.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.380
Like with AJAX calls,

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.940
many times that's the

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.100
case that you just

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:02.920
need to sort of grab

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.440
the JSON and you can

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.440
get the data easily.

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.100
Well, and it's

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.440
formatted JSON, right?

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.560
It's not just HTML.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.600
I mean, it's like

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.560
pretty sweet actually

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.120
to get a hold of

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:11.560
that feed.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.240
Oh, yeah.

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.420
But on the other

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.280
side, if you cannot

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.860
find an API like

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:16.900
this, you need to

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.540
execute JavaScript using

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.240
some kind of headless

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.740
browser like Selenium

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.440
or Puppeteer or

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:23.980
Splash.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.060
And because, you know,

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:25.580
you need an actual

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:26.820
browser to execute

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:27.300
JavaScript.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:27.840
Right.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.080
But then it's

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.700
going to take more

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.240
hardware resources to

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:32.800
run JavaScript.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.560
So it's going to be

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.340
slower and it's going

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.240
to make the whole

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.600
process a little bit

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.300
more complicated.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:38.940
Yeah.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.440
There's probably no

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.300
mechanism built right

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.660
into Scrapey that

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:43.800
will render the

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.520
JavaScript, is there?

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.360
Like Scrappy itself

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.460
cannot render JavaScript,

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.140
but there is a really

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:50.280
neat integration with

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:50.820
Splash.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:51.400
Okay.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.060
Splash is also

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:53.980
made, you know, it was

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.020
created by Scraping Hub,

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.420
so it's really easy to,

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.080
and Splash is sort of

00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.180
like a headless browser

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.900
created only for web

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:01.320
scraping.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.860
and you can integrate

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.720
Splash with Scrappy

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:05.880
really easily.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.140
It's literally just like

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.260
a middleware in Scrappy.

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.600
And then it will

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.740
execute JavaScript for

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:11.080
you.

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:11.500
Yeah.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:11.900
Sweet.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:12.480
Yeah.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.280
You will be able to

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.980
see the data and then

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:15.800
you will be able to

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.420
extract it.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:16.880
Right.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.200
It says the headless

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.080
browser designed

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.200
specifically for web

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:20.520
scraping.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.640
Turn any JavaScript

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.020
heavy site into data.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:23.720
Right.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.840
Cool.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.500
I'll put a link to

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:25.620
that.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.280
That's pretty neat.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:26.880
And that's open

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.220
source.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.020
People can just use

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:28.840
that as well or

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.780
what's the story with

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:29.920
that?

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:30.820
Yeah.

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:31.900
Just like Scrappy,

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:32.720
they can set up

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.480
their own server

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.680
and you can use it

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.040
that way or you can

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.220
also host it on

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:37.880
Scraping Hub.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.020
Talk Python To Me

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.040
is partially supported

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:42.760
by our training

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:43.100
courses.

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.620
How does your team

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:45.440
keep their Python

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.080
skills sharp?

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.280
How do you make

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.120
sure new hires get

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.160
started fast and

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:49.960
learn the Pythonic

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:50.220
way?

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.020
If the answer is a

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:52.900
series of boring

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:53.920
videos that don't

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.120
inspire or a

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.060
subscription service

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:56.960
you pay way too

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:57.640
much for and use

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.320
way too little,

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.220
listen up.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.520
At Talk Python

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:01.260
Training, we have

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.240
enterprise tiers for

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.120
all of our courses.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.420
Get just the one

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:05.140
course you need for

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.260
your team with full

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:07.180
reporting and

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:07.680
monitoring.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.020
Or ditch that

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:09.720
unused subscription

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.420
for our course

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:11.080
bundles which

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.000
include all the

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:12.700
courses and you

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:13.360
pay about the same

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:13.920
price as a

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.400
subscription once.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.000
slash business or

just email sales at

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:22.720
talkpython.fm.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.480
Yeah, so let's

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.520
maybe round out

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.200
our conversation

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:27.960
talking about

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:28.320
hosting.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.560
So I can go and

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.640
run web scraping on

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.940
my system and that

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:35.080
sometimes works pretty

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:35.940
well, sometimes it

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:36.380
doesn't.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:37.240
There was this time

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.360
a friend of mine was

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.120
thinking about getting

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.380
a car and putting it

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:40.920
on one of these car

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.180
sharing sites, keep it

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:42.860
a little bit general

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.260
and we wanted to

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.260
know like, okay, for

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.200
a car that's similar to

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.000
the kind of car he's

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:47.800
thinking about getting,

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.840
how often is it

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.080
rented?

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.200
What does it rent

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:50.520
for?

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:51.580
Like, so would it

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.240
be worthwhile as

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.440
just a pure investment,

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:54.760
right?

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:55.820
So I wrote up some

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:56.800
web scraping stuff

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.360
that would just

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.580
monitor like a couple

00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.420
of cars I picked.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.440
After a little while,

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.680
they didn't talk to

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.100
me anymore.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:03.460
The website was

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.500
mad at me for like

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.920
always asking about

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.440
this car.

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.080
Yeah.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.920
So that seems like

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:09.980
a common problem and

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:10.760
if I do that for my

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.500
house, I probably

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.520
can't check out that

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.580
site anymore for a

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:14.220
while, right?

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:14.700
I probably shouldn't

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:15.340
do it for my house,

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.120
but even from a

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.500
dedicated server, like

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:18.260
that might cause

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:18.700
problems.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.120
Yeah, it's not just

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:20.820
with web scraping.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:22.140
Like I remember I

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:22.960
was doing some kind

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.120
of financial research.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.280
It was about like one

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.060
of the cryptocurrencies

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.100
and I was using an

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:28.740
actual API.

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:29.420
Like I wasn't

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:29.860
scraping.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:30.460
I was using an

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.940
actual API and it

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:32.720
was pretty basic.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.340
Like I was just

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.720
learning how to use

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.160
this thing and I

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.580
created a for loop

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:39.500
and I put the

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.780
request, the API

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:41.640
request in the

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.240
for loop and I was

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.160
just testing and by

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.440
accident, I put like

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.400
a huge number in

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.240
the for loop, like

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:50.780
I don't know, like

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:51.540
a million or

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:51.960
something.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.820
And it created a

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:54.620
million requests.

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.000
I mean, it tried to

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.620
create a million

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.420
requests, but it

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.340
stopped after like,

00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:58.980
I don't know, maybe

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.940
like 10,000 requests

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:01.740
in a minute.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.100
Right.

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.120
And because, you

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:03.600
know, the server

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.400
didn't like that I

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:04.980
was doing that.

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.240
And it's the same

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:06.800
thing with web

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.120
scraping.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.340
You need to be

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:09.480
really careful not

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.700
to hit the website

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:11.980
too hard because

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.340
when you scrape the

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:14.380
web, it's really

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:14.800
important.

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:15.780
I mean, it's very

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.340
important to be

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.700
ethical and be

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:19.100
legal.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.460
And one of the

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.220
things that you can

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:21.920
do to achieve

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.180
these is to just

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.140
put some kind of

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.140
delay limit just

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.160
over a respect the

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:27.980
website and make

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:28.980
sure that you don't

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.120
cause any harm to

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:30.640
the website.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:31.120
Right.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.160
As soon as people

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.520
think that what

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.360
you're doing, you

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:34.900
think you're just

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:35.640
getting data, but

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.340
they might perceive

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.240
it as this is the

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.340
distributed denial

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:39.220
of service attack

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:40.100
against my site.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:40.880
We're going to

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.560
block this person,

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.020
right?

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:42.660
That's not a good

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.000
situation you want to

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:44.240
be in.

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.000
And it's also not

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.700
super nice to

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:46.260
whoever runs that

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.780
website to hammer

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:48.040
it.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:48.640
Exactly.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.660
The website doesn't

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.040
know what you want

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:51.460
to do.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:52.580
It just sees a bot

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:53.580
and it's really

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:54.420
like, you know,

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.180
because web scraping

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.640
itself is legal.

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.020
You can do it if it's

00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:58.740
a publicly available

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.040
website and you

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.880
need to make sure

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.020
that you are being,

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:03.940
I mean, we use this

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:04.700
in the web scraping

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:05.340
community.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.720
You need to be nice.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.060
You need to be nice

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.220
to the websites and

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:09.880
you know, you can

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.700
look at the robots

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:11.480
text file.

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.900
Usually there is a,

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:13.780
like a,

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.200
a delay specified

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:15.820
in the robots

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.600
text file that

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.440
tells you that,

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.640
hey, you should

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.500
put like three

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:20.440
seconds between

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.700
each request.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.180
And, but just

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:23.860
in general, even

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.740
if there is no

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.980
such a rule defined

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:26.500
in the robots

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:27.760
text file, you

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.160
should pay

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:28.700
attention.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.460
You should be

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.300
careful with your,

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.240
how many requests

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.200
you make, how

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.100
frequently you make

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.140
those requests.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.360
So yeah, it's

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:35.700
important.

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:36.120
Yeah.

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:36.780
Interesting.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.140
And so I guess

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.280
one option is you

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.060
guys have a cool

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.060
thing, which I just

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:42.780
discovered.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.300
I don't know how

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.100
new it is, but

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.940
scrappy D, a daemon

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:46.820
that lets you

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:48.760
basically deploy your

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.840
scrappy scripts to

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:51.920
it and it'll schedule

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.520
and run them and

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.180
that's pretty cool and

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:53.960
you can control that.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:54.740
So you could set that

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:55.840
up yourself or

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.040
obviously you have the

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.700
business side of your

00:39:58.700 --> 00:39:59.680
whole story, which is

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.520
scraping hub.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:01.520
So what does

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.520
scraping hub do that

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.420
makes this better?

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.260
Yes.

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:05.820
Then just like getting

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.480
a server at AWS or

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.400
Linode or something

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:08.800
like that.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.400
Yeah.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.340
So scraping hub is

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.500
really about, you can

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.320
deploy your spiders, but

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.480
it's really, it's made

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.640
for web scraping and

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.540
there is all the tools

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.600
available in the

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.500
scraping hub platform

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.180
that you would want to

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.200
use for web scraping.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.200
Like, you know, we

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.180
mentioned scrappy and

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.220
splash in the

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.120
scraping hub platform.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.100
You can upload your

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:29.520
spider, your scrappy

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.780
spider, and then you

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:31.920
can, with a click of

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:32.800
a button, you can add

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.320
splash.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.820
So it renders

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.380
JavaScript or you can

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.040
also, if you want to

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.340
use proxies for web

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.800
scraping, you can, with

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.720
a click of a button, you

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.540
can add proxies to your

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:44.060
web scraping.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.880
You can also, if you

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.300
have a website, like we

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:48.060
mentioned, you know,

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.920
articles and news, if you

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.180
want to extract data, we

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:52.340
have an API, so you

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:53.700
don't have to actually

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:54.980
write the spider.

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:56.240
You can just use the

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.260
API and get the data so

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:58.800
you don't need to

00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.640
maintain the code.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:00.620
So it's scraping

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.220
up is really just the, I

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:02.840
work at scraping

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.660
up, but I truly

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:04.440
believe that it's the

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.960
best platform if you're

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.260
doing web scraping at

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.720
scale, because you have

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.460
all the tools in one

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:11.580
place that you would

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:12.620
want to use for web

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:12.920
scraping.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.180
Right, right.

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.920
So a lot of the stuff

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.040
you might bring your own

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.600
infrastructure for, you

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.800
guys have like as a

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.580
service type stuff?

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:21.620
Yeah, exactly.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:22.920
You can sign up.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.680
We have a free trial for,

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:25.800
I think, for most of our

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.580
services.

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:27.440
You can try it.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.120
You can see how it

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:28.460
works.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.880
And then there's a

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.060
monthly fee and that's

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:31.180
it.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:31.600
Okay.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.780
Yeah, that seems pretty

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:33.080
awesome.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.720
And also we have a lot

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:35.660
of clients who don't want

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:36.800
to deal with the stuff,

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.620
deal with the technical

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:38.020
details.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.060
So they just say that,

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.600
hey, I want this type of

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.940
data from these websites,

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:42.920
give me the data.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.380
And so we just do the

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.200
hardware for them.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:45.640
Right.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.460
Maybe they're not even

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:47.100
Python people.

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:47.640
Yeah.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.120
They might be like, they

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:49.900
don't even know how to

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:50.820
code or like.

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:51.120
Right.

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.020
They could be political

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:52.480
scientists.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.380
They're like, we need to

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.100
just scrape this.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.400
But like you guys do

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:55.960
scraping, right?

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:56.620
Yeah.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.640
Yeah, exactly.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.060
So let's round out our

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.520
conversation on this.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.020
Just a quick comment on

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.280
Scraping Hub or a quick

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.040
thought on it.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.540
So when I talked to Pablo

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:08.100
back in 2016, so I had a

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:09.660
show with him about

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.900
Scraping and Scraping Hub

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:12.840
and all that back in

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.500
episode 50, four years ago

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:14.840
or something.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.160
One of the things that

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.380
really impressed me about

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:18.200
what you guys are doing

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.440
and continues to be the

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.260
case is you've taken

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:22.640
pretty straightforward

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.740
open source projects,

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.120
not something completely

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.500
insane, like a whole new

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.540
database model or

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.780
something, but just pretty

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:30.640
straightforward, but

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.360
polished model of web

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:32.680
scraping.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:33.520
And you built a really

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.000
powerful business on top

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:35.320
of it.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.620
And I think it's an

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.160
interesting model for

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.540
taking open source and

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:40.900
making it your job more

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.080
than just I'll do

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.520
consulting in this thing,

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:43.760
right?

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.600
If I wrote this web

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.800
framework, I could maybe

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.000
sustain myself by

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.240
consulting with people who

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.380
want to write websites in

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.320
that framework or so.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.620
But this is a pretty

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:53.340
interesting next level

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:54.660
type of thing that you

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.640
guys pulled off here.

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:56.160
And what are your

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:56.720
thoughts on this?

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.460
Yeah, 100% agree.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.700
Like I think, you know,

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.460
Pablo and Pablo Hoffman

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:02.580
and Shane Evans, they did

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.020
an awesome job when they

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.240
created Scrappy.

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.920
Like at the time, it was

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.300
the first real web

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:09.880
scraping framework, as I

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.140
know.

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.960
And they open sourced it.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.800
And it's really like if

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.540
you look at the GitHub

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.420
page of Scrappy, it's

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:17.520
really like I feel like

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.320
it's a community.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.120
Like people are chatting

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:20.780
about this.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.380
People are talking about

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.740
how the community can

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.160
improve this tool.

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.720
And then the fact...

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.340
You've got like 17,000

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.380
GitHub questions or

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:30.200
something like that.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:30.460
Oh, yeah.

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:31.160
Tagged on it.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:31.860
Yeah, it's quite a bit.

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:32.080
Yeah.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.040
And the fact that Pablo

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.260
and Shane were able to

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:36.520
pull this thing into

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:37.660
business, but in a

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:38.520
really...

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.500
Like people can still

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.940
use Scrappy without

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.000
using our services.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.460
They can still use

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.240
Splash without paying.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:45.960
They can use it.

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:46.720
It's open source.

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.420
So the fact that they

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.080
built on top of the

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.720
open source tools in a

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.220
way that you don't need

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:54.580
to be affiliated with the

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:56.080
company to get the

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.600
benefits of Scrappy and

00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.740
other open source tools.

00:43:58.740 --> 00:43:59.580
Like there are many

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:00.180
other tools.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.160
It's not just Scrappy.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.560
Like there are so many

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.720
other tools for web

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:04.020
scraping.

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:05.200
And I agree.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.300
I think it's just really

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.140
amazing that they have

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.120
been doing this.

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:09.560
Yeah.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:10.580
It seems like it's

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:11.660
really adding value

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:13.600
because if not the core

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.460
thing is already open

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:15.340
source and people would

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:16.260
just use it, you know?

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:16.840
Yeah.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.700
Like especially if they

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:19.800
want to do it at scale.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:20.200
Yeah.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.260
You just cannot do huge

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.460
things like millions of

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.700
extracted records or

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.380
things like that on your

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:27.960
computer or on your

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:28.420
laptop.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:29.540
You just cannot do that.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:31.760
No, you get about 50,000

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.460
and then you get blocked.

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.100
Yeah.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:33.620
Yeah.

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:34.580
That's an option as well.

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:36.100
Yeah, exactly.

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.120
So yeah, very cool.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.280
I think it's a really neat

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.780
example because a lot of

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:40.640
people are thinking about

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:41.720
how do I take this thing

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.660
that's got some traction

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:43.700
I'm doing with open source

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.320
and make this my job

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.940
because I'm tired of

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:48.500
filling Jira tickets at

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:49.480
this thing that's kind of

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:50.560
okay but not really my

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.240
passion, right?

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.380
And cool example.

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:53.940
So congrats to you guys.

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:54.680
Keep up the good work.

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:55.800
Yeah, we are.

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.340
We definitely try our best.

00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.400
There are some awesome

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.260
things to come in the

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:01.000
web scraping world,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.220
I believe, with the

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.580
advancements of machine

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:04.660
learning and other stuff.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.080
So it's going to be really

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.480
interesting to see what's

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:08.240
going to happen in the

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.080
next few years.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.140
Yeah, for sure.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:10.640
All right.

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:11.540
Well, I think that's probably

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:12.560
it for the time we got to

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.820
talk about web scraping.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:15.300
But the final two questions

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:16.240
before you get out of here,

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.140
you're going to write some

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:17.460
code.

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:18.660
What editor do you use?

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:19.340
Python code?

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:20.440
PyCharm.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:21.200
PyCharm.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:21.660
Right on.

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:23.560
And then notable PyPI

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:23.980
package.

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:25.380
I mean, there's obviously

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.900
pip install, scrappy, but

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.420
maybe some project that you

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:29.560
came across, you know, like,

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.440
oh, this is so awesome.

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:31.520
People should know about

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:32.100
X.

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:33.820
Oh, actually, it's a hard

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:35.800
question because I've been

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.500
sort of out of the game for

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:38.640
a lot of months now.

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:41.080
Aside from scrappy, I just

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.020
really like to, I don't have

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:43.980
one specific example.

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.020
I just really like to find

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.800
these GitHub repositories

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.140
where, when it's not like

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:50.760
a library, but it's like a

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.660
collection of, like, there

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.280
are many libraries, GitHub

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.800
repos with a collection of

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.360
templates.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:56.960
Right.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.240
You know, like, hey, if

00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.500
you're a beginner, you can

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:00.680
use these templates to get

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.100
started.

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.820
And for me, that was

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.060
really useful when I started

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.920
out with using a new tool

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:06.760
like scrappy or other

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.060
libraries is that you can

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.580
use these starter codes

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:12.060
sort of.

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:12.760
Right, right.

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:13.460
I wonder if there's a

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:15.300
better scrappy, possibly.

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:15.980
Probably.

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:16.400
Yeah.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:16.920
Yeah.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:17.580
There is.

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:19.180
I'll throw it into the

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:21.020
show notes, but yeah.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:21.720
Cool.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:23.440
But just cookie cutter, make

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:24.420
me a scrappy project.

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:25.580
Let's roll and do some

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:26.040
web scraping.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:26.600
Pretty neat.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.800
Also, there is a, you

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:28.460
know, just last note,

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:28.880
awesome.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.320
I think it's got awesome

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:30.920
web scraping.

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:31.620
OK.

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.000
Or something like that,

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.620
which has hundreds of

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:35.680
tools for web scraping.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:36.260
Oh, yeah.

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:38.020
We can link it later.

00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:39.420
Maybe if I find it.

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:39.840
OK.

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:40.380
Yeah.

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.680
It's got awesome web

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:42.540
scraping on GitHub.

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:43.140
Yeah.

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:43.580
Nice.

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:44.400
I'll put that in the show

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:45.060
notes as well.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.520
I love those awesome lists.

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:46.860
Yeah.

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:48.160
It's easy to get lost

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.100
because you were like, oh,

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.120
I have this one thing and I

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:50.460
use it.

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:51.440
Then all of a sudden you're

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.780
like, oh, look at that.

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.000
There's like 10 other

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.360
options in this thing that I

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:55.920
thought I knew.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.080
Yeah, exactly.

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:57.900
Awesome.

00:46:58.340 --> 00:46:58.620
All right.

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.120
Attila, it's been great to

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.660
chat with all these, share

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:02.500
all these web scraping

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.560
stories and chat with you.

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.420
So thanks for being here.

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:05.440
Yeah, it's been amazing.

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:05.940
Thank you.

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:06.600
Thank you very much.

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:07.360
Yeah, you bet.
