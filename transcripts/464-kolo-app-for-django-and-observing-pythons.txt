00:00:00 Do you want to look inside your Django requests?

00:00:02 How about all of your requests in development and see where they overlap?

00:00:06 If that sounds useful, you should definitely check out Kolo.

00:00:10 It's a pretty incredible extension for your editor.

00:00:13 VS Code at the moment, more editors to come.

00:00:15 Most likely we have Wilhelm Klopp on to tell us all about it.

00:00:19 This is Talk Python to Me episode 464 recorded May 9th, 2024.

00:01:28 Well, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:01:31 Hello.

00:01:32 Yeah.

00:01:32 Excited to be here, Michael.

00:01:33 I've been listening to Talk Python like for, I can't even remember how long, but

00:01:36 I'm pretty sure it was before I had a first Python job.

00:01:38 So yeah, a long, long time.

00:01:40 That's amazing.

00:01:42 Well, now you're helping create it.

00:01:44 Yeah, exactly.

00:01:44 We're going to talk about Kolo, your Visual Studio Code Django.

00:01:49 I don't even know what to call it.

00:01:50 It's pretty advanced, pretty in-depth extension seems to be not quite enough.

00:01:54 So what any project people are going to really dig that people who Django and

00:01:59 we'll see what the future plans are.

00:02:01 If we could talk you into other, other ones, but for now Django plus.

00:02:06 100%.

00:02:06 Yeah.

00:02:07 Yeah.

00:02:07 Django plus VS Code is going to be super interesting.

00:02:09 When we get to that, of course, you must know the drill.

00:02:12 Tell us a bit about yourself.

00:02:13 Yeah, for sure.

00:02:14 So my name is Will.

00:02:15 I've been using Django since, well, I guess I've been using Python since about

00:02:20 2013, I want to say.

00:02:22 So a little over 10 years and yeah, just kind of like fell in love with it.

00:02:26 Wanted to make websites, started using Django and yeah, I guess never really

00:02:31 looked back.

00:02:32 That was in school back then, but kind of always had a love for like tinkering and

00:02:37 building side projects.

00:02:38 I actually studied, I did a management degree in university, but I really loved

00:02:42 hanging out with all the computer science kids, all the computer science students.

00:02:44 And I think a part of me really wanted to impress them.

00:02:47 So I was always building side projects.

00:02:49 And one of them was actually a Slack app called SimplePol.

00:02:52 And yeah, we were trying to like, you know, organize something in Slack and really

00:02:56 felt like the need for polls.

00:02:57 So built this little side project just like during university.

00:03:01 And then it became really, really popular.

00:03:02 And a few years later it became my full-time job.

00:03:06 So for the past like four years, I've been running SimplePol as a Slack app,

00:03:11 building out the team up to like seven, eight of us.

00:03:13 And I had a great time doing that.

00:03:15 In the middle, I actually worked at GitHub for two years, working on Ruby and Rails.

00:03:19 And that was super fun, like a great company, great people, huge code base.

00:03:23 Learned a lot there.

00:03:24 That was really fun.

00:03:25 But yeah, I left after about two years to work full-time on SimplePoll.

00:03:29 So SimplePoll had been running as a side project kind of in the background.

00:03:31 And actually it's interesting, like, and in kind of the order of events, thinking

00:03:35 back, Microsoft was, acquired GitHub while I was there.

00:03:39 And then suddenly all of my colleagues started talking about buying boats and

00:03:45 leaving the company.

00:03:45 And I thought, hmm, I don't quite have boat money, but how can I, what's an ace

00:03:53 I might have up my sleeve?

00:03:54 And it was SimplePoll, which had got like tons of users, but I never monetized it.

00:03:58 So I set out to monetize it.

00:04:00 And then a year later it was actually bringing in more revenue than my salary

00:04:04 at GitHub.

00:04:04 So I decided, decided to quit.

00:04:06 So that's kind of the SimplePole backstory.

00:04:08 So SimplePole is a Django app, reasonably sized now, a bunch of people working on

00:04:12 it.

00:04:12 And then, yeah, at some point in the journey of building SimplePoll, I kind of

00:04:16 started playing around with Kolo.

00:04:18 So Kolo also kind of, just like SimplePoll started as a side project, but now not to

00:04:22 make polls in Slack, but instead to improve my own developer experience building

00:04:27 SimplePoll.

00:04:27 So kind of built it as an, as my own tool for making Django, working with Django

00:04:33 more fun, give me more insight, give me access to some of the data that I felt

00:04:36 was so close, but that I had to just like manually get in there and print out.

00:04:41 So the reason Kolo started out as supporting just Django and VS Code is because

00:04:46 that's what I was using and it was an internal side project.

00:04:48 And now actually handed over SimplePoll to a new CEO.

00:04:53 I'm no longer involved day to day and I'm working full time on Kolo.

00:04:57 Man, congratulations on like multiple levels.

00:05:01 That's awesome.

00:05:01 Thank you.

00:05:02 Yeah.

00:05:02 I want to talk to you a bit about SimplePoll for just a minute, but before then you

00:05:07 pointed out like, look, I made this side project and how many hours are you

00:05:11 spending on it a week maybe?

00:05:12 Oh, it was interesting.

00:05:13 So honestly, like, so this would like right at the beginning, like when it, when it

00:05:16 was first started, I, yeah, it's a good time.

00:05:17 It's a good, it's a good question.

00:05:19 The, I always joke that the best thing about my management degree was that I had

00:05:22 a lot of free time to like do build side projects.

00:05:25 Honestly, I think it could have been like 20, 30, 40 hours a week.

00:05:28 Yeah.

00:05:28 Yeah.

00:05:29 That was, yeah, I think, yeah, it definitely varied week to week.

00:05:32 And then later on?

00:05:33 Yeah.

00:05:33 And then while I was working, when I had a full-time job as a software engineer,

00:05:36 yeah, that was a lot tougher.

00:05:37 It was like nights and weekends rarely had energy during the week to work on it.

00:05:41 And then honestly, like, since it was a real project with real users, I ended up

00:05:45 spending a lot of the weekend doing like support, like support stuff.

00:05:49 Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:50 Support.

00:05:50 And like, then you charge and then now you have finance stuff and like legal stuff to

00:05:54 do so that, that wasn't super fun.

00:05:56 Like it really slows down the features and the creation of stuff.

00:06:00 Exactly.

00:06:01 Yeah.

00:06:01 I would say I probably spent fully 50% of my full-time job doing email support, that

00:06:08 kind of stuff, you know, just like there's tons of people taking courses and listen to

00:06:12 the podcast and they'll have questions and thoughts and you know, and it's, it's

00:06:16 awesome, but it also is really tricky.

00:06:18 So the reason I ask is I always find it fascinating.

00:06:21 You'll see like news articles.

00:06:24 I don't know.

00:06:24 They're always click baity or whatever.

00:06:25 This person makes three times their job working 10 hours a week on this other

00:06:30 thing, like you make three times what you make for your job.

00:06:32 What are you doing at your job?

00:06:34 Right.

00:06:36 The ability to say you can make that step where you go from kind of tired at nights,

00:06:41 extra time and squeezing on the weekends to full-time full energy.

00:06:44 Yeah.

00:06:44 If it's already doing well, you know, on like a very thin life support, like then

00:06:49 give it full energy, you know, full time and energy.

00:06:50 It's just, of course it's going to be better.

00:06:52 Right.

00:06:52 It's so interesting.

00:06:53 I actually have a lot of thoughts about this.

00:06:55 Maybe I should write something about this at some point, but yeah, I actually think

00:06:58 running like a bootstrap side project kind of business as you have a job can be really

00:07:03 good because it really forces you to prioritize and build the most important

00:07:07 things.

00:07:08 Yeah.

00:07:08 It's kind of like having kids.

00:07:09 Oh, nice.

00:07:10 Yeah.

00:07:10 Yeah.

00:07:10 I need to try that someday.

00:07:11 You'll be real tired.

00:07:13 I tell you, you'll, you'll love to prioritize your time.

00:07:15 Yeah.

00:07:16 I think it really forced you to prioritize.

00:07:17 So I actually sometimes recommend when folks ask me like for advice, like should I quit

00:07:21 my job to go all in or not?

00:07:23 I actually sometimes think there's a lot of nice stability and that comes from, from

00:07:27 having a job.

00:07:28 Plus it's actually really nice to have coworkers.

00:07:30 It's nice to have structure.

00:07:31 Like you actually need to take all of that.

00:07:33 Well, work in a way on yourself.

00:07:36 Like it's, you know, if you have to make your own structure, like if you're building

00:07:39 your own thing and that can actually be a bit tricky.

00:07:41 Like I really struggled with that at the beginning.

00:07:42 So I think there's something to be said for, yeah.

00:07:45 For, for spending like a limited time on something basically and prioritizing just,

00:07:48 just the most interesting angle.

00:07:50 And I don't necessarily disagree with that.

00:07:52 I know that's interesting.

00:07:52 So for me, it was interesting, like in terms of like how much, like, you know, life

00:07:57 support energy you put in versus like full time energy.

00:08:00 It was growing decently.

00:08:02 Like while I was still at GitHub and I thought, okay, I'm going to go in on this

00:08:07 full time.

00:08:07 And if I go from like 10 hours a week or less to like 40 hours a week, that would

00:08:13 probably Forex the growth rate as well.

00:08:14 That's how it works.

00:08:15 Right.

00:08:16 And like, totally didn't like it totally didn't work.

00:08:19 In fact, like the month after I left, I had like my first down month where like the

00:08:25 revenue decreased.

00:08:26 And I was like, wait a minute, what's going on here?

00:08:28 How that doesn't make any sense.

00:08:29 That's not fair.

00:08:30 So I think that also points that like there, yeah, you can definitely spend more hours

00:08:34 on something and it can be like the wrong things or not doubling down on something

00:08:38 that's really working.

00:08:39 So, but overall, obviously you, at some point, like just being able to like test out

00:08:44 more ideas is like really valuable.

00:08:45 And for that, like, if you only have time to do support on your product, that's really

00:08:50 working well.

00:08:50 And your full time job is the rest of the, how you spend your week, then yeah, it feels

00:08:55 like you should give yourself some time to build features and maybe quit the job.

00:08:58 Yeah.

00:08:59 It's also an interesting point about the structure because not everyone is going to

00:09:05 get up at eight o'clock, sit at their desk and, and they're going to be like, you know,

00:09:08 I kind of could just do whatever.

00:09:10 And it's, it's a, it's its own discipline, its own learned skill.

00:09:14 A hundred percent.

00:09:14 Yeah.

00:09:14 I remember like one of the first weeks after I was full time on SimplePool, I woke up in

00:09:20 the morning and said, well, the money's coming in.

00:09:22 I don't need to work.

00:09:23 I don't have a boss.

00:09:23 And I just sit in bed and watch YouTube videos all day.

00:09:26 And then I just felt miserable at the end of the day.

00:09:29 Like the, I was like, this is supposed to feel great.

00:09:31 Why all this freedom I've wanted and dreamt about for so long?

00:09:34 Where like, why does it not feel great?

00:09:36 Yeah.

00:09:38 Also, also feels like risk and more different kinds of responsibility.

00:09:42 All right.

00:09:42 So SimplePoll, the reason I said it'd be worth talking about a little bit is, you know,

00:09:47 Slack's a popular platform and this is based on Django, right?

00:09:50 So Simplepolll is a full on Django app.

00:09:51 Yeah.

00:09:52 And it's funny.

00:09:53 Sometimes people joke that, I don't know if you've gone through the official Django

00:09:57 tutorial, but in there you actually make a polls app in the browser.

00:10:00 Sometimes people joke, wait, did you just turn this into like a Slack app?

00:10:05 And then you productize it.

00:10:06 The getting started tutorial.

00:10:07 Yeah, exactly.

00:10:09 But yeah, like it turned out that like polls and then yeah, getting, you know, your team

00:10:14 more connected and Slack and more engaged are like things people really care about.

00:10:19 So it came to the Slack, SimplePoll joined the Slack platform like at the perfect time

00:10:23 and has just been growing super well since then.

00:10:27 Tell people a little bit about what it takes technically to make a Slack app.

00:10:32 I mean, Slack is not built in Python as far as I know.

00:10:35 And it's, it's probably JavaScript and Electron, mostly the people interact with.

00:10:39 Right.

00:10:40 So what is the deal here?

00:10:41 It's actually super interesting.

00:10:42 So the way you build like a Slack app, it's actually all backend based.

00:10:47 So when a user interacts in Slack, Slack sends your app, your backend, like a JSON

00:10:51 payload saying like this user clicked this button, and then you can just send a JSON

00:10:56 payload back saying, all right, now show this message.

00:10:59 Now show this modal.

00:11:00 And they have their own JSON based block kit framework where you can render different

00:11:05 types of content.

00:11:06 So you don't actually have to think about JavaScript or react or any of their stack at

00:11:10 all.

00:11:10 It's basically all sending JSON payloads around and calling various parts of the Slack

00:11:14 API.

00:11:15 So you can build a Slack app in your favorite language, any kind of exotic language if you

00:11:20 want it to.

00:11:20 But yeah, I love Python.

00:11:23 So I decided to build it in Python and Django.

00:11:25 So yeah, actually building Slack apps is a really like pleasant experience.

00:11:29 What's the deployment backend story look like?

00:11:32 Is it a pass sort of thing?

00:11:35 Serverless?

00:11:36 VMs?

00:11:37 At the time it was Heroku.

00:11:39 Simplify was running on Heroku.

00:11:40 And then I think a few years ago we migrated it to AWS.

00:11:45 So now it's running on AWS and ECS.

00:11:48 Nice.

00:11:49 Okay.

00:11:49 So Docker for the win.

00:11:51 Right on.

00:11:51 How does it work in Talk Python?

00:11:52 I'm curious.

00:11:52 How, what's, where are you deployed?

00:11:54 It's all DigitalOcean.

00:11:55 And then I have one big like eight CPU server running, I think, 16 different Django apps.

00:12:04 Not Django, sorry, Docker apps.

00:12:06 No, sorry, Docker apps that are all doing like, you know, some of them share a database that's in

00:12:12 Docker and some of them do sort of have their own self-contained pair of like web app and

00:12:19 database and so on.

00:12:20 But it's all Docker on one big server, which is fairly new for me.

00:12:25 And it's glorious.

00:12:26 It's glorious.

00:12:27 That's awesome.

00:12:27 Very cool.

00:12:28 Yeah.

00:12:28 All right.

00:12:29 So again, congrats on this.

00:12:32 Very, very neat.

00:12:33 Let's talk Kolo.

00:12:35 Let's do it.

00:12:35 I first came across this, I've come across it independently twice.

00:12:40 Once when the Django chat guys recommended that I talk to you because they're like, Will's doing

00:12:48 cool stuff.

00:12:48 You should definitely talk to him.

00:12:50 Saying a thing for VS Code is super cool.

00:12:52 But also I can't remember, there's somebody on your team whose social media profile I came across

00:12:58 and I saw this and I'm like, oh, this is, this is pretty neat.

00:13:01 I think we even covered it on the Python Bytes podcast.

00:13:04 Oh, no way.

00:13:04 Let's see.

00:13:05 Yeah, sure.

00:13:06 In January we did.

00:13:07 So that's what we talked about a little bit, but this just looks like such a neat thing.

00:13:11 And it's, I encourage people to, who may be interested in this, to visit colo.app because

00:13:17 it's a super visual sort of experience of understanding your code.

00:13:21 Right?

00:13:21 Would you agree?

00:13:22 Yeah.

00:13:22 I mean, a hundred percent.

00:13:23 Yeah.

00:13:23 Funny thought.

00:13:24 I hadn't really thought that a podcast is going to be a hard way to describe the visual beauty

00:13:30 and magic that Kolo can bring to your code.

00:13:32 But yeah, a hundred percent.

00:13:33 Yeah.

00:13:33 So Kolo like very much started as like the idea of, Hey, like I should be able to see

00:13:38 like how my code actually flows.

00:13:40 I think like all of us, as we build software, as we write our Python code, we have this

00:13:45 kind of like mental model of how all the different functions like fit together.

00:13:49 How like a bit of data ends up from like the beginning, like to the end, like it passes

00:13:54 through maybe a bunch of functions, it passes through a bunch of like classes, a bunch of

00:13:58 loops, all the state gets like modified.

00:14:00 And we have this kind of like mental picture of all of that in our head.

00:14:04 And the kind of very beginning of Colo, the question I asked myself was like, is there

00:14:09 a way we can just like visualize that?

00:14:11 Is there a way we can just actually print that out onto a screen?

00:14:15 So if you go to kolo.app, it kind of looks like this funny sun chart with like lots of

00:14:19 kind of a sunny tree chart with lots of nodes, nodes going from the center and like going

00:14:25 off into the distance, which I think is like, yeah, similar to like what folks kind of

00:14:29 might already have in their head about like how the code flows.

00:14:32 Maybe another way to describe it is imagine like you enable a debugger at the

00:14:40 beginning of every function and at the end of every function in your code and you print

00:14:45 out like what was the function name, what were the input arguments, what was the return

00:14:49 value? And then you arrange all of that in a graph that then shows which function called

00:14:54 which other function.

00:14:55 It almost looks like what you get out of profilers.

00:14:57 Right. You know, where you say like, OK, this function took 20 percent, but if you

00:15:01 expand it out, I'll say, well, it really spent 5 percent there, 10 percent there, and

00:15:05 then a bunch of it. And you kind of traverse that.

00:15:07 A hundred percent.

00:15:08 Yeah. I'm guessing you're not really interested in how long it took, although maybe you

00:15:12 can probably get that out of it.

00:15:13 It's the important is more what is the dependency?

00:15:16 What are the variables being passed and like understanding individual behavior, right?

00:15:21 Or maybe. Yeah.

00:15:22 What do you think? Yeah, a hundred percent.

00:15:23 I think like it's interesting because Kolo actually uses under the hood like a bunch of

00:15:26 the Python profiling APIs and people often think of Kolo as a profiler.

00:15:31 We do actually have a traditional profiling based chart which puts the timing at the

00:15:35 center. But you're absolutely right that the focus of our like main chart, the one that

00:15:40 we're both looking at that has like this idea of the function overview and like which

00:15:46 function calls which the idea there is like absolutely the hierarchy and seeing like

00:15:50 giving yourself that same mental model that someone who's worked on a code base for

00:15:54 three months has in their head immediately like yourself by just looking at it.

00:15:58 This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Sentry.

00:16:03 Code breaks. It's a fact of life.

00:16:05 With Sentry, you can fix it faster.

00:16:07 As I've told you all before, we use Sentry on many of our apps and APIs here at

00:16:12 Talk Python. I recently used Sentry to help me track down one of the weirdest bugs I've

00:16:17 run into in a long time.

00:16:19 Here's what happened. When signing up for our mailing list, it would crash under a

00:16:23 non-common execution pass like situations where someone was already subscribed or

00:16:28 entered an invalid email address or something like this.

00:16:31 The bizarre part was that our logging of that unusual condition itself was crashing.

00:16:38 How is it possible for her log to crash?

00:16:41 It's basically a glorified print statement.

00:16:43 Well, Sentry to the rescue.

00:16:45 I'm looking at the crash report right now, and I see way more information than you'd

00:16:49 expect to find in any log statement.

00:16:51 And because it's production, debuggers are out of the question.

00:16:54 I see the traceback, of course, but also the browser version, client OS, server OS,

00:17:01 server OS version, whether it's production or Q&A, the email and name of the person

00:17:05 signing up. That's the person who actually experienced the crash.

00:17:08 Dictionaries of data on the call stack and so much more.

00:17:11 What was the problem?

00:17:12 I initialized the logger with the string info for the level rather than the

00:17:18 enumeration dot info, which was an integer based enum.

00:17:22 So the logging statement would crash saying that I could not use less than or equal to

00:17:27 between strings and ints.

00:17:28 Crazy town.

00:17:30 But with Sentry, I captured it, fixed it, and I even helped the user who experienced

00:17:35 that crash.

00:17:36 Don't fly blind.

00:17:37 Fix code faster with Sentry.

00:17:39 Create your Sentry account now at talkpython.fm/sentry.

00:17:43 And if you sign up with the code TALKPYTHON, all capital, no spaces, it's good for two

00:17:49 free months of Sentry's business plan, which will give you up to 20 times as many

00:17:53 monthly events as well as other features.

00:17:56 Usually in the way these charts turn out, you can notice that there's like points of

00:18:02 interest. Like there's one function that has a lot of children.

00:18:04 So that clearly is coordinating like a bunch of the work where you can see kind of

00:18:08 similarities in the structure of some of the sub trees.

00:18:12 So, you know, OK, maybe that's like a loop and it's the same thing happening a couple

00:18:15 times. So you can essentially I get this overview and then it's fully interactive and

00:18:21 you can dive in to like what exactly is happening.

00:18:23 Yeah. Is it interactive?

00:18:25 So I can like click on these pieces and it'll pull them up.

00:18:28 We actually and this is what's it'll be live by the time this podcast goes live.

00:18:32 We actually have a playground in the browser.

00:18:34 This is also super fun.

00:18:36 We can talk about this. Well, let me drop you a link real quick.

00:18:38 This will be a play.kolo.app.

00:18:40 So with this, yeah, this is super fun because this is fully Python just running in the

00:18:45 browser using Pyodide and like WebAssembly.

00:18:47 Nice. OK.

00:18:48 But yeah, so this is the fully visual version where you can.

00:18:51 Yeah. It defaults to loading like a simple Fibonacci algorithm.

00:18:55 Yeah. And you can see like what the visualization of Fibonacci looks like.

00:19:00 And you can actually edit the code and see how it changes with your edits and all of

00:19:03 that. We have a couple other examples.

00:19:05 Wow. The pandas one and the whack-a-mole one are pretty intense.

00:19:08 They're pretty wild pictures.

00:19:09 They look like sort of Japanese fans or whatever.

00:19:12 You know, those little gamer ones.

00:19:13 We once had a competition at a conference to see who could make like the most fun

00:19:17 looking algorithm and then visualize it with Colo.

00:19:20 But yeah, like it's fun.

00:19:21 Like visualizing code is really great.

00:19:23 That's awesome. So this is super cool.

00:19:26 It's just just all from scratch.

00:19:28 It's besides Pyodide here.

00:19:30 Not like VS Code in the browser or anything like that.

00:19:34 I think it's using Monaco in this case or CodeMirror.

00:19:37 But otherwise, this is all is this Pyodide and a little bit of React to like pull kind

00:19:41 of the data together. But yeah, we're really.

00:19:43 Yeah. It's otherwise homemade.

00:19:46 This is kind of like the kind of what Kolo has been for like like the past like two

00:19:51 years or so has been this kind of side project for our SimplePoll to help like just

00:19:55 visualize and understand code better.

00:19:57 The SimplePoll codebase, to be honest, has grown so large that like there's parts of

00:20:01 it that I wrote like five years ago that I don't understand anymore.

00:20:05 And it's like annoying to get back to that and having to spend like a day to

00:20:08 re-familiarize myself with everything.

00:20:10 It's a lot nicer to just like to actually kind of explain like end to end how it

00:20:14 works. You install like in a Django project, you install Kolo as a as a middleware.

00:20:19 And then as you just browse and use your Django app and make requests, traces get

00:20:26 saved. So Kolo records these traces.

00:20:28 They actually get saved in a local SQLite database.

00:20:32 Then you can view the traces, which includes the visualization, but also like lots of

00:20:36 other data like you can actually see in the version you have there.

00:20:39 Like we show every single function call, like the inputs and outputs for each

00:20:43 function call. So that main idea of Kolo is to like really show you everything that

00:20:47 happened in your code.

00:20:48 So in a Django app, that would be like the request, the response, like all the headers,

00:20:53 every single function call, input and output, outbound requests, SQL queries as

00:20:57 well. So really the goal is to show you everything.

00:21:00 You can view these stored traces either through VS Code.

00:21:04 And this is also will be live by the time this episode goes live through like a web

00:21:08 middleware version, which is a bit similar to Django debug toolbar.

00:21:12 Not sure if you've played around much with Django debug.

00:21:14 Yeah, a little bit. Yeah. And those things are actually pretty impressive.

00:21:17 Right. I played out with that one and the pyramid one.

00:21:20 And you can see more than I think you would reasonably expect from just a little thing

00:21:25 on the side of your web app.

00:21:26 Yeah, exactly. And that's very much our goal to like very kind of deep insight in our

00:21:31 minds. This is almost like a bit like old news.

00:21:34 Like we've been using this for like a few years, basically.

00:21:36 And then at some point, like last year, we started playing around with this idea of

00:21:41 like, OK, so we have this trace that has information about like pretty much everything

00:21:46 that happened in like a request.

00:21:48 Is there any way we could use that to solve this like reasonably large pain point for

00:21:52 us, which is like writing tests?

00:21:54 I'm actually curious. Do you enjoy writing tests?

00:21:56 I'll tell you what I used to actually.

00:21:58 I used to really enjoy writing tests.

00:22:01 I used to enjoy thinking a lot about it.

00:22:02 And then as the projects would get bigger, I'm like, you know, this is these tests don't

00:22:08 really cover what I need them to cover anymore.

00:22:10 And they're kind of dragging it down.

00:22:12 And then, you know, the thing that really kind of knocked it out for me is I'd have

00:22:16 like teammates and they wouldn't care about the test at all.

00:22:18 So they would write, break the tests or just write a bunch of code without tests.

00:22:23 And I felt kind of like like a parent cleaning up after kids.

00:22:27 You're like, why is it so?

00:22:28 Can we just pick up? Why are there dishes here?

00:22:30 And they're just going around.

00:22:32 I'm like, this is not what I want to do.

00:22:34 Like, I want to just write software.

00:22:35 And I understand the value of tests, of course.

00:22:38 A hundred percent.

00:22:39 Yeah. At the same time, I feel like maybe higher order integration tests often, for

00:22:45 me at least, serve more value because it's like I could write 20 little unit tests or I

00:22:50 could write two integration tests and it's probably going to work.

00:22:53 I'm actually completely with you on that.

00:22:54 OK, right on.

00:22:55 The bang for the buck of integration tests are like great, like really, really useful.

00:23:00 You can almost think of tests as having like two purposes, one being like, well,

00:23:05 actually, I think this would be too simple an explanation.

00:23:08 Let me let me not make grand claims about all the uses of tests.

00:23:11 I think the most the use of it that most people are after is this idea of like what I've

00:23:17 built isn't going to break by accident.

00:23:20 Yeah. Like you want confidence that any future change you make doesn't impact a bunch

00:23:25 of unrelated stuff that it's not supposed to impact.

00:23:27 I think that's what most people are after with with tests.

00:23:32 And I think for that specific desired result, like integration tests are the way to go.

00:23:37 And there's some cool writing about this from I wrote a little blog post about Colos

00:23:41 test generation abilities.

00:23:43 And in there, I link to a post from Kent C.

00:23:46 Dodds from the JavaScript community, who has a great post about I think it's called

00:23:49 write tests, not too many, mostly integration, kind of after this idea of like, yeah, nice.

00:23:55 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:56 Eat not too much, mostly vegetables.

00:23:58 I think that's the.

00:23:59 Yeah, exactly.

00:24:00 Exactly.

00:24:00 Yeah.

00:24:01 I'm a big fan of that.

00:24:02 And actually, it's interesting.

00:24:03 I've speaking to a bunch of folks over the past year about tests.

00:24:06 A lot of engineers think about writing tests as vegetables.

00:24:10 And obviously, some people love vegetables and some of us love writing tests.

00:24:14 But it seems like for a lot of folks, it's kind of like a obviously necessary part of

00:24:19 creating great software.

00:24:20 But it's maybe not like the most fun part of our job.

00:24:24 Or you pick up some project, you're a consultant, or you're taking over some open

00:24:29 source project, you're like, this has no tests, right?

00:24:31 It's kind of like running a linter.

00:24:34 And it says there's a thousand errors.

00:24:35 You're like, well, we're not going to do that.

00:24:36 Yeah, we're just not going to run the linter against it because it's just too messed up

00:24:41 at this point, right?

00:24:42 It's interesting you mentioned the picking up like a project with no tests, because I

00:24:45 think within the next three months, we're not quite there yet.

00:24:48 But I think in the next three months with Kolo's test generation abilities, we'll have

00:24:51 a thing where, yeah, all we need is a Python code base to get started.

00:24:55 And then we can bring that to like a really respectable level of code coverage just by

00:25:00 using Kolo.

00:25:01 Okay.

00:25:01 How?

00:25:02 That's kind of describing a second ago how like we, SimplePoll has tons of integration

00:25:08 tests.

00:25:08 SimplePoll actually is about 80,000 lines of application code, not including migrations

00:25:13 and like config files.

00:25:14 And then it's about 100,000 lines of tests.

00:25:17 And most of that is integration tests.

00:25:20 So SimplePoll very well, very well tested lots of really mostly integration tests.

00:25:24 But it is always a bit of a chore to like write them.

00:25:27 So we started thinking about like, hmm, this like Kolo tracing we're doing, can that help

00:25:33 us with making tests somehow?

00:25:34 And then we started experimenting with it.

00:25:36 And like to our surprise, it's actually, yeah, I'm still sometimes surprised that it

00:25:39 actually works.

00:25:40 But basically the idea is that if you have a trace that has that captures everything in

00:25:47 the request, you can kind of invert it to build a integration test.

00:25:53 So let me give an example of what that means.

00:25:55 The biggest challenge we found with creating integration tests is actually the test data

00:26:01 setup.

00:26:02 So getting your application into the right shape before you can send a request to it or

00:26:07 before you can call a certain function, that's like kind of the hardest part.

00:26:11 Writing the asserts is almost like easy or even like fun.

00:26:15 Right.

00:26:15 There's the three A's of unit testing range, assert, and act, wait, arrange, act, and

00:26:20 assert.

00:26:21 Exactly.

00:26:21 Yeah.

00:26:21 Yeah.

00:26:21 The first and the third one that you kind of have data on, right?

00:26:25 Exactly.

00:26:25 Yeah.

00:26:25 So we're like, wait a second.

00:26:27 We actually can like kind of extract this, like the act.

00:26:31 So like the setting, sorry, the arrange, setting up the data, the act, like actually

00:26:36 making the HDP request and then the assert, like to ensure the status change or that the

00:26:42 request go to 200 or something.

00:26:43 We actually have the data for this.

00:26:44 It's reasonably straightforward.

00:26:46 Like if you capture in, you know, just your like normal, like imagine you have a local

00:26:50 to do app and you browse like a to do kind of demo, simple to do app and you browse to

00:26:55 the homepage and the homepage maybe lists the to dos.

00:26:57 And if you've got Kolo enabled, then Kolo will have captured the request, right?

00:27:01 So like the request went to the homepage and it returned a 200.

00:27:05 So that's already like two things we can now turn into code in our integration test.

00:27:09 So first step being, well, I guess this is the act and the assert in the sense that the

00:27:14 assert is the 200 and then the act is firing off a request to the homepage.

00:27:19 Now the tricky bit, and this is where it gets the most fun, is the arrange.

00:27:23 So if we just put those two things into our test and our two imaginary test, there

00:27:29 wouldn't have been any to dos there.

00:27:30 Right.

00:27:30 So it's actually not an interesting test yet, but in your local version where the

00:27:33 trace was recorded, you actually had maybe like three to dos already, already in your

00:27:38 database.

00:27:39 Does that make sense so far?

00:27:40 Yeah.

00:27:41 Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:41 On the homepage, like your to do app might make a SQL query to like select all the to

00:27:47 dos or all the to dos for the currently logged in user.

00:27:50 And then Kolo would store that SQL query, would store that select and would also store

00:27:55 actually what data the database returned.

00:27:57 This is actually something where, yeah, Kolo goes beyond a lot of the existing kind of

00:28:01 like debugging tooling that might exist, like actually showing exactly what data the

00:28:05 database returned in a given SQL query.

00:28:07 But imagine we get like a single to do returned, right?

00:28:11 We now know that to replicate this like trace in our test, we need to start by seeding

00:28:18 that to do into the database.

00:28:20 That's where like the trace inversion comes in.

00:28:22 If like a request starts with a select of like the to do table, then the first thing

00:28:29 that needs to happen in the integration test is actually a like creating like an insert

00:28:33 into the database for that to do.

00:28:35 And now when you fire off the request to the homepage, it actually goes through your real

00:28:40 code path where like an actual to do gets loaded and gets printed out onto the page.

00:28:44 So that's like the the most basic kind of example of like, how can you turn like a

00:28:49 locally captured trace of a request that like made a SQL query and return 200 into like

00:28:55 an integration test?

00:28:56 Yeah, that's awesome.

00:28:57 One of the things that makes me want to write fewer unit tests or not write a unit test

00:29:02 in a certain case is I can test given using mocking, given my let's say SQLAlchemy or

00:29:10 Beanie or whatever Django ORM model theoretically matches the database.

00:29:15 I can do some stuff, set some values and check that that's all good.

00:29:19 But in practice, if the if the shape, if the schema in the database doesn't match the

00:29:24 shape of my object, the system freaks out and crashes and says, well, that's not going

00:29:28 to work, right?

00:29:29 There's no way.

00:29:30 And so it doesn't matter how good I mock it out.

00:29:32 It has to go kind of end to end before I feel very good about it.

00:29:36 Oh, yeah.

00:29:37 OK, it's going to really, really work, right?

00:29:38 Exactly.

00:29:39 That's an interesting story.

00:29:40 Like you're saying to like, let's actually see if we can just create the data, but like

00:29:45 let it run all the way through.

00:29:46 Right.

00:29:46 I'm totally with you.

00:29:47 And and I think I've often seen like unit tests pass and say, I mean, there's like lots

00:29:51 of memes about this, right?

00:29:52 How like unit tests say everything is good, but the server is down.

00:29:55 Like, how is that possible?

00:29:56 I think in Django world, it's reasonably common to write integration tests like this, as in

00:30:01 like the actual database gets hit.

00:30:03 The you have this idea of like the Django test client, which sends like a, you know,

00:30:08 real in air quotes, HTTP request through the entire Django stack as opposed to doing the

00:30:14 more unit test approach.

00:30:15 So it hits the routes.

00:30:16 It hits like all of that sort of stuff all the way.

00:30:19 Yeah.

00:30:20 And the template.

00:30:21 Yeah.

00:30:21 And then at the end, you can assert based on like the content of the response or you can

00:30:26 check.

00:30:26 Like, imagine if we go back to the to do example, if we're testing like the add to do

00:30:31 endpoint or form submission, then you could make a database query at the end.

00:30:36 And Kolo actually does this as well, because like, again, we know like that you inserted

00:30:41 to do in your request, so we can actually make an assert.

00:30:44 This is a different example of the trace inversion.

00:30:47 If there's an insert in your request that you captured, then we know at the end of the

00:30:52 integration test, we want to assert that this row now exists in the database.

00:30:56 So you can assert at the very end to say, does this row actually exist in the database

00:31:01 now?

00:31:01 So it's a very nice kind of reasonably end to end, but still integration test.

00:31:05 It's not like a brittle click around in the browser and kind of hope for the best kind of

00:31:09 thing.

00:31:10 It's like, as we said at the beginning, I think like integration tests just get you

00:31:13 great bang for your buck.

00:31:14 They really do.

00:31:15 It's like the 80/20 rule of unit testing for sure.

00:31:20 Yeah.

00:31:20 Talk Python to me is partially supported by our training courses.

00:31:24 If you're a regular listener of the podcast, you surely heard about Talk Python's online

00:31:29 courses, but have you had a chance to try them out?

00:31:31 No matter the level you're looking for, we have a course for you.

00:31:34 Our Python for absolute beginners is like an introduction to Python plus that first

00:31:39 year computer science course that you never took.

00:31:41 Our data-driven web app courses, build a full pypi.org clone along with you right on the

00:31:47 screen.

00:31:48 And we even have a few courses to dip your toe in with.

00:31:50 See what we have to offer at training.talkpython.fm or just click the link in your

00:31:55 podcast player.

00:31:56 So is this all algorithmic?

00:31:59 Yup.

00:31:59 Great question.

00:32:00 Is it LLMs?

00:32:01 Like how much VC funding are you looking for?

00:32:04 Like, you know, like if you got LLMs in there, like coming out of the woodwork.

00:32:07 No, I'm just kidding.

00:32:08 No, how do you, how does this happen?

00:32:10 It's actually all algorithmic and rule-based at the moment.

00:32:13 So this idea of a select becomes like a, like a, an insert and an insert becomes like a

00:32:20 select assert.

00:32:21 We were surprised how far we could get with just rules.

00:32:24 The benefit we have is that we kind of have this like full-sized SimplePoll Django code

00:32:29 base to play around with.

00:32:30 And yeah, like generating integration tests in SimplePoll just like fully works.

00:32:35 There's a bunch of tweaks we like had to make to, as soon as I guess you work in kind of

00:32:40 like outside of a demo example, you want like time mocking and HTTP mocking and you want

00:32:46 to use your like factory boy factories and maybe you have a custom unit test, like base

00:32:52 class and all of this.

00:32:53 But yeah, it like, it actually works now.

00:32:55 I gave a talk at DjangoCon Europe last year.

00:32:58 It's kind of like a bit of a wow moment in the audience where, yeah, you just click

00:33:02 generate test and it generates you like a hundred line integration test and the test

00:33:06 actually passes.

00:33:07 So that was like, people started, just started clapping, which was a great feeling.

00:33:11 I'm still a bit surprised that it works on it, but yeah, no LLM at all.

00:33:15 I do think like LLMs could probably make these tests like even better.

00:33:19 Or you know how I was saying a second ago, like in three months we could go take a code

00:33:23 base from like zero test coverage to maybe like 60%, 80%.

00:33:28 I imagine if we made use of LLMs that would help make that happen.

00:33:33 Yeah.

00:33:33 Yeah.

00:33:34 You could talk to it about like, well, these things aren't covered.

00:33:37 Right.

00:33:38 What can we do to cover them?

00:33:39 Yeah.

00:33:39 I don't know if you maybe could do fully, fully automated, just push the button and

00:33:44 let it generate it.

00:33:45 But you know, it could also be like a conversational, not a conversation, sort of a

00:33:49 guided, let's get the rest of the test, you know, like, okay, we're down to 80, we've

00:33:53 got 80%, but there's the last bit are a little tricky, like what ones are missing?

00:33:57 All right.

00:33:57 So how do you think we could do this?

00:33:59 Is that about, no, no, you need to, that's not really the kind of data we're going to

00:34:02 pass.

00:34:02 You know, I don't know.

00:34:03 It seems something like that.

00:34:04 Right.

00:34:04 I really liked that.

00:34:05 I had not thought about like a conversation as a way to generate tests, but that makes so

00:34:09 much sense.

00:34:10 Right.

00:34:10 It kind of bring in the developer along with them where it's gotten too hard or something,

00:34:15 you know?

00:34:15 Yeah.

00:34:16 There's something cool about just clicking a button and see how much code coverage you

00:34:18 could get to, but chatting to it.

00:34:21 I think also, honestly, like so far, like our test generation logic is a bit of a black

00:34:27 box.

00:34:27 It just kind of like works until the point where like it doesn't.

00:34:31 So we're actually kind of in the, in the process of like shining a bit more of a light

00:34:35 into like, like essentially the like internal data model that Kolo keeps track of to know

00:34:40 what the database state should be like in this arrange part of the integration test.

00:34:45 And yeah, we're actually like in the process of like, yeah.

00:34:49 Talking to a bunch of users who are already using it and also finding like companies who

00:34:54 want to increase their, increase their test coverage or who have problems with their

00:34:58 testing and want to improve that and kind of working closely with them to make that

00:35:02 happen.

00:35:03 That's kind of a huge focus for us as we figure out like, how do we want to monetize

00:35:07 Kolo?

00:35:07 Like so far Colo has just been kind of supported by SimplePoll as a, as a side project,

00:35:11 but we're kind of making it real, making it its own business.

00:35:14 So, and we think the test generation is going to play a big part in that.

00:35:18 Right.

00:35:18 Like that could be a, certainly a premium team feature sort of thing.

00:35:21 Exactly.

00:35:22 Yeah.

00:35:22 Yeah.

00:35:22 Yeah.

00:35:23 Enterprise.

00:35:24 Enterprise version comes with auto testing.

00:35:26 Yeah, exactly.

00:35:28 Something like that.

00:35:28 Yeah.

00:35:29 If there's anyone listening and like they're keen to increase their code coverage, please

00:35:32 email me.

00:35:32 Maybe we can leave my email in the, in the notes or something like that.

00:35:35 Yeah.

00:35:35 I'll put your contact info in the show notes for sure.

00:35:37 It's actually really nice.

00:35:38 It's just w@colo.app.

00:35:40 Oh, very nice.

00:35:41 So yeah.

00:35:41 If, if anyone's listening and wants to kind of like increase their code coverage or has a

00:35:45 lot of code bases that have zero coverage that would benefit from getting to like some

00:35:49 level of coverage, we'd love to help you and talk to you.

00:35:52 Even if the solution doesn't like involve using Kolo, just really, really keen to talk to

00:35:56 anyone about like Python tests and, and what can be done there.

00:35:59 So yeah, please hit me up.

00:36:01 Awesome.

00:36:01 Yeah.

00:36:02 I'll definitely put some details in the show notes for that.

00:36:04 I have some questions as well.

00:36:05 Please.

00:36:05 Yes.

00:36:06 Right here.

00:36:06 I'm looking at the webpage and the, the angle bracket title is Kolo for Django.

00:36:12 But in the, the playground thing you sent me, it was on plain Python code.

00:36:17 It was on algorithms.

00:36:19 It was on pandas, which I thought was pretty interesting how much you could see inside

00:36:22 pandas.

00:36:22 Makes me wonder, you know, if you look at the web frameworks, there's two or three more

00:36:27 that are pretty popular out there and they all support middleware.

00:36:29 Yeah.

00:36:30 A hundred percent.

00:36:30 So Colo kind of started as like this, like side project for our Django app.

00:36:35 And I think that that's why we kind of went there first.

00:36:37 It's kind of the, the audience we know best.

00:36:40 You do dog food as well.

00:36:41 Yeah.

00:36:41 Exactly.

00:36:42 Dog fooded Lily.

00:36:43 Who's, who's an engineer on the team is, and who's been building a lot of, yeah, a

00:36:48 lot of the Python side of Kolo is like a core contributor to Django.

00:36:53 So Django is like really where we're home.

00:36:55 And to be honest, I think when building a new product, it's kind of nice to keep the

00:36:59 audience somewhat small initially keep like building for very specific needs as

00:37:04 opposed to going like very wide, very early.

00:37:06 That was kind of very much, very much the intention, but there's no reason why Kolo

00:37:10 can't support Flask, FastAPI, the scientific Python stack, as you can see in

00:37:16 the playground, it does totally work on, on plain Python.

00:37:18 It's really just a matter of.

00:37:20 Honestly, like FastAPI support would probably be like a 40 line config file in

00:37:26 it, exactly in like our code.

00:37:28 And there's actually, yeah, we're thinking of ways to make that actually a bit more

00:37:33 pluggable as well.

00:37:34 There's only like so many things we can reasonably support.

00:37:38 Well, ourselves.

00:37:39 I was going to say if somebody else out there has an open source project, they want it to

00:37:42 have good support for this, right?

00:37:44 Like, Hey, exactly.

00:37:44 Yeah.

00:37:45 I run HTTPS or I run light star or whatever, and I want mine to look good here too.

00:37:50 Right.

00:37:50 Totally.

00:37:51 So the thing you can do already today is there's a little bit of config you can pass

00:37:55 in.

00:37:55 And actually, if you look back on the pandas example, you'll, you'll see this by

00:37:59 default.

00:37:59 Kolo actually doesn't show you library code if you use it in your own code base, but you

00:38:04 can tell it, show me everything that happened, like literally everything.

00:38:08 And then it will, it will do that for you.

00:38:09 So in this example you're looking at, or if anyone's looking at the playground, if you

00:38:13 look at the pandas example, it'll say like include everything in pandas.

00:38:16 And that'll give you like a lot more, a lot more context.

00:38:19 The thinking there is that most people don't really need, like the issues you're going

00:38:23 to be looking at will be in your own code or you're in your own company's code base.

00:38:27 You don't really need to look at the abstractions, but you totally can.

00:38:30 But yeah, to answer the question, like we have this like internal version of a plugin

00:38:33 system where yeah, like anyone could add FastAPI support or like a great insight into

00:38:40 PyTorch or what have you.

00:38:42 The way it all works technically really is it's totally built on top of this Python API

00:38:47 called set profile.

00:38:48 I'm not sure.

00:38:48 Have you used, have you come across this before?

00:38:51 It's a bit similar to set trace actually.

00:38:52 Yeah, I think so.

00:38:53 I think I've done it for some C profile things before.

00:38:58 I'm not totally sure.

00:38:59 Yeah.

00:38:59 It's a really neat API to be honest, because Python calls back to your, like the callback

00:39:05 that you register on every function, enter and exit.

00:39:08 And then Kolo essentially looks at all of these functions, enters and exits and decides

00:39:12 which ones are interesting.

00:39:13 So the matter of like supporting say FastAPI is basically just telling Kolo these are

00:39:19 the FastAPI functions that are interesting.

00:39:21 This is the FastAPI function for, for like an HTTP request that was served.

00:39:25 This is the HTTP response.

00:39:27 Or similarly for SQL alchemy, this is the function where the query was actually executed

00:39:32 and sent to the database.

00:39:33 This is the variable which has the query result.

00:39:35 Like there's a little bit more to it and I'm definitely like, yeah, generalizing, but

00:39:40 it's kind of like in principle, it's as simple as that.

00:39:43 It's like telling Kolo, here's the bits of code in a given library that are interesting.

00:39:46 Now just kind of like display that and make that available for the, for the test generation.

00:39:50 Excellent.

00:39:51 Yeah.

00:39:51 I totally agree with you that it getting focused, it probably gets you some more full

00:39:56 attention from the Django audience and the Django audience is quite a large and

00:40:01 influential group in the Python web space.

00:40:02 So that, that makes it totally, especially since you're using it.

00:40:05 By the way, it was Lily's Mastodon profile, I believe that I ran across that I first

00:40:10 discovered Kolo from.

00:40:11 So of all the places, yeah.

00:40:13 Or a, a, a post or something like that.

00:40:16 That's awesome.

00:40:17 Cool.

00:40:17 All right.

00:40:17 So let's talk about a couple other things here.

00:40:20 For people who haven't seen it yet, like you get quite a bit of information.

00:40:24 So if you see like the get request, you actually see the JSON response that that

00:40:29 was returned out of that request and it integrates kind of into your editor

00:40:34 directly, right?

00:40:35 If you've seen code lens before, it's kind of like code lens, right?

00:40:38 Yeah.

00:40:38 This is another thing which I think is, is pretty novel with, with Kolo.

00:40:41 Like I think it's reasonably common for existing debugging tools to show you like,

00:40:46 Oh yeah, this is the headers for the request, or this is like the response status

00:40:50 code.

00:40:50 But especially working with the Slack API in simple poll, you're constantly looking

00:40:55 at payloads and what were the values for things and what are you returning.

00:40:59 In production, you don't directly get to even make those or receive those requests,

00:41:03 right?

00:41:03 There's some like system in Slack who was like chatting with your thing.

00:41:07 You're like, well, what is happening here?

00:41:09 Right.

00:41:09 Not that you would actually run this in there, but you know.

00:41:12 I mean, it's funny you mentioned this because there is one experiment we want to

00:41:16 run of kind of actually enabling these extremely deep and detailed Kolo traces

00:41:20 in production.

00:41:21 We haven't explored this too much yet, and I think we're going to focus a little bit

00:41:25 more on the test generation, but you could imagine like a user who's using, who's on

00:41:30 the talk Python side and they've, they've got some incredibly niche error that no one

00:41:35 else is, is like encountering and you've tried to reproduce it, but you can't

00:41:40 reproduce it.

00:41:40 Maybe there's a little bit of information in like your logging system, but it's just

00:41:45 not enough.

00:41:45 And you keep adding more logging and you keep adding more logging and it's just not

00:41:48 helping.

00:41:49 Like imagine a world where you can say just for that user, like enable Colo and

00:41:53 enable like these really deep traces.

00:41:55 And then you can see whenever the user next interacts, like the value for every

00:42:01 single variable for every single code path that executed for that user.

00:42:04 That's just like, yeah.

00:42:06 I think one of our users described as like a debugger on steroids.

00:42:09 Yeah.

00:42:09 Yeah.

00:42:09 It's pretty interesting.

00:42:10 Sounds a little bit like, like what you get with Sentry and some of those things,

00:42:15 but maybe also a little bit different.

00:42:18 So, you know, you could do something like, here's a dear user with problem.

00:42:23 Here's a URL.

00:42:24 If you click this, it'll set a cookie in your browser and then all subsequent

00:42:28 behavior, it just hits on it.

00:42:30 You know what I mean?

00:42:31 It's like recording it.

00:42:32 Yeah.

00:42:32 That'd be pretty interesting.

00:42:33 Yeah.

00:42:33 I think it makes sense in the case.

00:42:35 Like if a user, it could even be an automated support thing, right?

00:42:39 Like if a couple of sites have this where you can like do like a debug dump before

00:42:43 you submit your support ticket, this is almost like, like that.

00:42:47 And then as an engineer who's tasked with digging into that user's bug, you don't

00:42:51 have to start with like piecing together.

00:42:53 What was this variable at this time when they made that request three days ago?

00:42:58 You like, you can just see it.

00:43:00 If an error ever encounters an exception on your site, you just set the cookie.

00:43:04 Right.

00:43:04 All everything else they do is now just recorded until you turn it off.

00:43:07 Oh my God.

00:43:08 You're giving me so many good ideas.

00:43:09 That'd be fun.

00:43:10 I'm going to start writing this stuff down.

00:43:11 Let's record it.

00:43:13 It'll be fine.

00:43:13 That's awesome.

00:43:14 Yeah.

00:43:14 There's a bunch of stuff that's, that's, that's interesting.

00:43:16 People can check it on the site.

00:43:17 It's, it's all good.

00:43:19 However, we talked a little bit about the production thing.

00:43:22 Like another thing you could do for production, if this requires both a decent amount of traffic and maybe, maybe you could actually pull this off on just a

00:43:30 single server, but you could do like, let's just run this for 1% of the traffic so that

00:43:35 you don't kill the system, but you get, you know, if that's why I see you have

00:43:39 enough traffic, it's like statistically significant sampling of what people do

00:43:43 without actually recording a million requests a day or something insane.

00:43:48 A hundred percent.

00:43:48 I think there's really something there, or like, I could go on about this whole

00:43:52 idea of like runtime data and like improving software understanding for days.

00:43:55 Because I just think like, it's really this like missing layer, right?

00:43:58 Like all of us constantly imagine like, what is like, we play computer looking at

00:44:03 our code, imagining what the values can be, but like, yeah, say you're looking at

00:44:07 some complex function in production and you want to understand how it works.

00:44:11 Like how useful would it be if you could see like the 10, the last 10 times it was

00:44:14 called, like what, what were the values going into it and what were the values

00:44:17 coming out of it?

00:44:18 Like, that would be, I just think like, why do we not have this already?

00:44:22 Like, why does your editor not show you for every single function in the code base,

00:44:26 give examples of like how it's actually used like in production.

00:44:30 Yeah.

00:44:30 And then use those to generate unit tests.

00:44:32 And if there's an error, use that to generate the edge case, like the negative

00:44:35 case, not the positive case unit test.

00:44:37 Right.

00:44:37 There you go.

00:44:38 Exactly.

00:44:38 It's all like kind of hanging together.

00:44:40 Like, yeah.

00:44:41 Yeah.

00:44:42 Once you have the data, you have interesting options.

00:44:44 Yeah.

00:44:44 Business model.

00:44:45 This is not this, I maybe should have started sooner with this, but it's not

00:44:49 entirely open source that maybe a little, little bits and pieces of it, but in

00:44:53 general, it's not open source.

00:44:54 That's correct.

00:44:55 Yeah.

00:44:55 No, I'm putting that out there as a negative, right?

00:44:57 This looks like a super powerful tool that people can use to write, write code

00:45:00 and that's fine.

00:45:01 Yeah.

00:45:02 I think the open source question is super interesting.

00:45:03 Like it's always been like something we've thought about or, or considered.

00:45:08 I think there is, yeah, with, with developer tools, I think business models are always super interesting and we want to make sure that we can have a

00:45:15 business model for Kolo and like run it as like a sustainable thing, as opposed to

00:45:19 it just being like a simple poll side project kind of indefinitely be great.

00:45:23 If Kolo could like support itself and yeah, have a business model, I think that's how

00:45:27 it can like really fulfill its potential in a way, but that's not to say that like

00:45:30 Kolo won't ever be open source.

00:45:32 Like I think there's a lot to be said for open sourcing it.

00:45:35 I think especially like the, the capturing of the traces is maybe something like I

00:45:41 could see us open sourcing.

00:45:42 I think the open source community is fantastic.

00:45:44 I do also think it's not like a thing you get for free, right?

00:45:48 Like as soon as you say, Hey, we're open source, you open yourself up to

00:45:53 contributions, right.

00:45:54 And to like the community actually getting involved and that's great, but it also

00:45:58 takes time.

00:45:59 And I think like that's a path I would like to go down when we're a little bit

00:46:03 clearer on like what Kolo actually is and like where it's valuable.

00:46:08 If that makes sense.

00:46:09 Yeah, sure.

00:46:10 If it turns out that no one cares about like what, how, like how to visualize code,

00:46:14 then like, that's a great like learning for us to have made, but I'd rather get

00:46:20 there without like a lot of work in the middle that we could have kind of avoided

00:46:24 if that makes sense.

00:46:25 So for sure, it feels like once we have a better sense of the shape of Kolo and what

00:46:29 the business model actually looks like, then we can be a bit more, yeah, we can

00:46:35 invest into open source a little bit more.

00:46:36 But to be honest, like based on how everything's looking right now, I would

00:46:40 not be surprised at all.

00:46:41 If like big chunks, it's like Kolo becomes open core or big chunks of it are like

00:46:46 open source.

00:46:46 It makes sense to me.

00:46:47 It is fully free at the moment.

00:46:49 So I should, that's worth calling out.

00:46:50 Yeah.

00:46:51 There's no cost or anything.

00:46:52 You can also like, you know, you download the Python package and guess what?

00:46:55 You can look at all of the code.

00:46:57 Like it actually is all of theirs.

00:46:59 It is all kind of visible.

00:47:01 That kind of leads into the next question is I've never used GitHub Copilot and a few

00:47:06 of those other things because it's like here, check this box to allow us to upload

00:47:11 all of your code and maybe your access keys and everything else that's interesting.

00:47:15 So we can one, train our models and two, you know, give you some answers.

00:47:19 And that just always felt a little bit off to me.

00:47:21 What's the story with the data?

00:47:24 At the moment, Kolo is like entirely like a local product, right?

00:47:27 So it's all local.

00:47:29 Like you don't have to, you can get like all of the visualization, everything just

00:47:33 by using local Kolo in, in VS Code.

00:47:36 We do have a way to like upload traces and share them like with a colleague.

00:47:40 This is actually also something I think is like kind of playing with the idea of like

00:47:44 writing a little like Kolo manifesto.

00:47:46 Like what are the things that we believe in?

00:47:47 One of them that I believe in, and this goes back to the whole like runtime layer on top

00:47:52 of code.

00:47:52 And like, there is this whole dimension, this like third dimension to code that we're

00:47:57 all simulating in our heads.

00:47:58 I think like it should totally be possible to not just like link to a snippet of code

00:48:03 like on GitHub, but it should be possible to have a like link, like a URL to a specific

00:48:09 execution of code, like a specific function and actually talk about that.

00:48:13 It's kind of wild to me that we don't have this at the moment.

00:48:15 Like you can't send a link to a colleague saying, Hey, look at this execution.

00:48:20 That looks a bit weird.

00:48:21 We ran this in continuous integration and it crashed, but I understand.

00:48:25 Let's look at the exact.

00:48:26 Right.

00:48:27 The whole deal.

00:48:28 You can link to like CI runs.

00:48:29 You can link to like sentry errors, but like if you're just seeing something slightly weird

00:48:33 locally or like even something slightly like weird in production where there's no area,

00:48:37 you can't really like link, link to that.

00:48:40 Anyway, like this is kind of a roundabout way of me saying that, like, I think that

00:48:44 totally should be a thing.

00:48:45 Like you should be able to link like generically to like a execution of a function or an

00:48:49 execution of a request.

00:48:50 And like that would totally have to live somewhere.

00:48:54 Right.

00:48:54 So this is where there's some idea of like Kolo cloud comes in and this is where you

00:48:58 could like connect your, your repository.

00:49:01 And then Kolo would like, as part of that, you know, just like get help, does have

00:49:05 access to your code and like show you the code and in like the colo cloud.

00:49:08 So I think there's definitely like useful things that are possible there, but at the

00:49:13 moment it's a fully local experience.

00:49:15 Like your, your code doesn't ever leave your, your system.

00:49:19 You can, if you want to like upload traces and then Kolo stores the like trace data,

00:49:24 not, not the code, just the trace data.

00:49:26 But yeah, very local experience right now.

00:49:28 Yeah.

00:49:29 A little SQLite database.

00:49:30 Exactly.

00:49:30 Yep.

00:49:31 Yeah.

00:49:31 SQLite's pretty awesome.

00:49:32 It's a fightable piece of software.

00:49:34 Yeah, it really, really is.

00:49:35 Let's close out our conversation here with a little bit of a request from Michael.

00:49:39 Right now it's VS Code only.

00:49:41 Any chance for some PyCharm in there?

00:49:43 This is our top request, like PyCharm support.

00:49:45 Yeah.

00:49:46 And we've decided super small team, like we want to kind of support everyone, but

00:49:50 we've been working very heavily actually the past few months on a web-based version,

00:49:55 which is, I'm happy to say like very much nearing completion.

00:49:58 And there's a few bits and pieces where like, it's really nice to be integrated

00:50:02 super deeply into the editor, like the code lenses and, and all of that.

00:50:06 And I think there's a chance we'll have that for PyCharm eventually as well.

00:50:09 But we actually found that like building out this web version, there's a few things

00:50:13 that are actually much nicer when you have the full control over the UI in terms of

00:50:17 like browsing around a trace, highlighting little bits of code.

00:50:20 So for example, in Kolo, like a given function call, we call a frame and you

00:50:25 can look at a given frame, both in VS Code, but also in the web version and see the

00:50:29 code and see all of the data that passed through the code.

00:50:32 But something we can do in the web version we can't do in VS Code is actually show

00:50:36 where the current function was called from and actually show like a preview of that

00:50:40 code.

00:50:40 In VS Code, you can't really show like, you can layer multiple files together or

00:50:45 different.

00:50:45 Yeah, exactly.

00:50:46 Yeah.

00:50:46 There's actually a lot of, like, I was surprised by how many different novel,

00:50:50 like kind of ways we had in the web that we just never even considered with like a

00:50:56 direct editor integration in terms of displaying this runtime data.

00:50:59 So like, long story short, like you, you know, want a PyCharm integration.

00:51:03 Let me give you something even better.

00:51:05 Yeah.

00:51:05 Web version.

00:51:06 So would that work like you run a certain command or something when you run your web

00:51:12 app and then it just generates the SQL lite file and then you could just explore it

00:51:16 with a web view or what are you?

00:51:17 Yeah, it's actually kind of cooler than that.

00:51:19 So if you're using Django or in the future, like other things with a typical

00:51:23 middleware, you would just like go to your, you would just go to localhost

00:51:27 8000/hello.

00:51:28 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:51:29 Kind of like you do for open API docs.

00:51:33 Yep.

00:51:33 And then the whole experience is just there.

00:51:35 If you're not using a middleware, we'll have a command like colo serve or something

00:51:39 like that.

00:51:40 And that'll yeah.

00:51:41 Host the same experience for you.

00:51:43 Just make sure it's off by default or it only, it only responds on localhost or

00:51:48 something like that.

00:51:49 You know, like, yeah, exactly.

00:51:50 Don't let people ship it on accident.

00:51:52 That would be bad news.

00:51:54 No production use of this.

00:51:55 Yeah.

00:51:55 I mean, people already know about the Django debug settings, but right.

00:52:00 I guess you could sort of layer onto that, right?

00:52:02 Probably.

00:52:02 Yeah.

00:52:03 I think we actually do that at the moment.

00:52:04 But yeah, it's worth, worth remembering.

00:52:06 No, I just think, you know, like, well, this is really cool.

00:52:10 It makes for a hundred percent.

00:52:12 CNN.com is awesome.

00:52:13 Look what it's doing.

00:52:14 Look at all these requests and all this.

00:52:16 Yeah, exactly.

00:52:18 A hundred percent.

00:52:19 Yeah.

00:52:19 Oh, and the API key is so interesting.

00:52:21 Anyway, that's a bit of a side, a side conversation.

00:52:25 So let's just, let's wrap it up with the final call to action.

00:52:28 People are interested.

00:52:29 What do they do?

00:52:30 Yeah.

00:52:30 Colo.app and check it out.

00:52:32 We have a playground link there.

00:52:33 Play.kolo.app.

00:52:35 Easiest way to kind of see what Kolo is and what Colo does, but we'll say the

00:52:39 most powerful way to, to actually see Colo in action is to use it on your own

00:52:43 code base.

00:52:43 So seeing the visualization and the test generation capabilities is just like,

00:52:48 yeah, the most useful when you use it on your code base.

00:52:51 So hopefully the playground can entice that a little bit.

00:52:53 And yeah, really the main, most important thing for us right now is, yeah.

00:52:57 Chatting to folks who want to increase their test coverage, want to like build

00:53:01 automated testing as part of their workflow.

00:53:03 And yeah, work very closely with you to make that happen.

00:53:05 So if that's you, please email me at w@colo.app.

00:53:09 You need that pause for the W that's right.

00:53:12 Or the two, the two at's.

00:53:13 Awesome.
