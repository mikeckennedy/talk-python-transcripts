00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.880
Have you ever wondered about the software stack powering Talk Python, the training websites,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.500
the mobile apps, the video and audio delivery, and more?

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.220
While at first glance, it might seem pretty simple.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.140
There's quite a bit going on, actually.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.180
We have our own custom search engines.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.560
We deliver about 15 to 20 terabytes of traffic per month.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.600
Our course video streams from eight locations throughout the world.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.240
Our database server is sending about 12 megabits of traffic sustained all day, all night,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.380
with no media in the mix.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.580
And all of this stuff is powered by Python.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.920
So this week, it's a bit of a role swap.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.280
Dan Bader from RealPython is here to interview me about the Talk Python tech stack.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.420
But we do get a chance to compare my tech stack with RealPython's,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.580
a site which is becoming quite an important one for developers in the Python world.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:52.140
This is Talk Python to me, episode 215, recorded on scene at PyCon 2019 in Cleveland on May 6th, 2019.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:11.640
Welcome to Talk Python to me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.580
This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.720
Follow me on Twitter, where I'm @mkennedy.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.460
Keep up with the show and listen to past episodes at talkpython.fm.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.960
And follow the show on Twitter via at Talk Python.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.000
This episode is sponsored by Linode and Backlog.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.080
Please check out what they're offering during their segments.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.340
It really helps support the show.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.420
All right.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.760
Hey, folks.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.040
We got a little bit of a different one this week.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.460
So I'm excited to be here with Dan Bader from realpython.com.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.520
Hey, how's it going, everybody?

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.580
It's good to see you, Dan.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.040
Likewise.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.400
This is so unreal because the last couple of times when I was on your show,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.500
we were not sitting right next to each other at a hotel in Cleveland,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.900
but we were doing this over Skype.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.480
And so it's kind of cool, actually.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.200
It's super cool.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.380
Yeah.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.800
And greetings, everyone, from the tail end of PyCon.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.980
Not quite from the conference floor anymore since they cleaned that up.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.120
So now we're at the hotel floor.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.480
Yeah.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.680
And it was a really sweet conference.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.400
I mean, I don't know.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.300
I'm sure you had a great, fantastic time, too.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.700
I know you were always swarmed and surrounded by people and fans

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.420
that want to take photos and chat with you.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.780
And yeah, it's really, really cool.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.920
It's one of my favorite times of the year, honestly.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.620
It's exhausting, but it's great.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.920
Yeah.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.320
Yeah.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.480
I know it was an awesome conference.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.920
I mean, thanks to everybody who organized it and put it on.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.520
It was really, really amazing.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.520
I feel like it's just getting better and better every year.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.680
And there's more interest in Python.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.780
And it's just so cool to hang out with the community.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.460
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.800
You meet all these people that you collaborate with on the internet or other things.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.720
And you would never run into them because they live in Australia or Vancouver or wherever.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.140
Yeah.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.440
But here you run into all of them.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.940
It's amazing.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.320
Yeah.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.420
It's really, really cool.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.980
And one of the things I like the most is when you've been working with somebody or you know

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.940
them online, but you never actually met them or been on a video call.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:49.840
And then you run into them.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.000
You're like, oh my God, I had no idea.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.640
Oh, this is you.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.600
Like, this is so cool.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.180
And it's, yeah, it's just been a ton of fun.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.480
Yeah.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.860
Another one of the takeaways, I guess, is everyone's just a person, right?

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.860
Like all these people working on these amazing projects.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.540
They're really open to meet you and share ideas.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.720
And like, if you just go and say hi, like chances are, you know, that you'll get to learn a lot

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.440
about, you know, whatever you're interested in.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.740
Totally.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.940
Yeah.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.580
I think everybody is really, really welcoming.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.420
And I mean, that's the whole point.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.080
I mean, that's, I'm sure it's the same thing for you.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.640
Like, that's why I go to these conferences, right?

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.480
To hang out and meet new people.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.900
I'm not going there to hide behind my laptop or just be in like business mode, but it's

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.000
just fun to walk around and chat and grab a cup of coffee or beer with somebody.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.700
Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.100
I consider this my geek holiday.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.400
Yeah.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.280
So I did say the opening that we have something a little bit different.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.520
So we're going to sort of reverse the roles.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.860
And Dan is going to interview me somewhat, but we're also, I'm also going to have a lot of

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.560
questions for you, Dan.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.100
Sounds good.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.340
Yeah.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.160
I'm looking forward to this.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.800
So a lot of folks have asked various questions at different angles, like how have you built

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.060
your Python stack?

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.760
Or why are you serving your audio this way?

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.620
Or how did you build your new mobile apps that you released?

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.980
Just all these different questions about the tech involved in the podcast and the training

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.940
and all the derivative stuff from that.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:14.380
So I decided, Dan, you would be the best person to sort of represent the audience on that side

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.400
of the conversation.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.480
Because one, you're super knowledgeable.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.900
We're good friends.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.660
But also, because you are also running a pretty high-end website.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.220
Like, RealPython is one of the biggest Python sites out there these days, isn't it?

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.600
I mean, it's kind of hard to measure that in terms of, I don't know, like impact and everything.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.480
But I can share some stats.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.880
We just hit 1.3 million unique users per month.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.620
So that's like several million page views a month just on RealPython.com alone, which

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.840
to me is just an insane number.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.080
So yeah, I think, first of all, thanks.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.600
And I think we're up there somewhere.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.920
Yeah.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.460
It's awesome.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.700
Yeah.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:59.060
It's definitely really, really growing since you've taken over stewardship of that resource

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.720
in the last year or two.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.260
And it's awesome to see.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.500
So we're going to talk about RealPython.com and what you're up to as well.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.840
Cool.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.120
All right.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.280
I guess one of the things I did want to start to set the stage with before we get into

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.520
this conversation is we'll talk about some part and people might go, well, why didn't

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.580
you build that serverless?

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.200
Or why isn't that a microservice?

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.000
Or couldn't you have hosted this here in that way?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.860
And probably the answer is yes, yes, and yes.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:32.120
But I'm not doing any of those because there's just a lot of ways to make this work, right?

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.600
There's a lot of choices out there.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.840
And I think maybe that's even why people are interested, right?

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.580
If like if it was you go to HP and you ask for a rack of servers and you set up this software

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.120
on it and you put it on the internet and that was the answer, like nobody would ask, how

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.800
many servers do you have?

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.120
I have three, one U servers.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.400
Okay.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.800
Interesting.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.080
Right.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.940
But because there are all these choices, I think it's interesting.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.180
But I also want to just set the stage, like the choice that you might have made may

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.980
be different than the choice I'm making or the choice that Dan is making.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.040
But, you know, just be aware, like they may all work, maybe better, maybe not.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.500
I don't know.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.340
But yeah, we're not judging.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.380
And so please give us the same favor in return.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.380
And I think there's also, you know, with all of this stuff, there's a huge like hindsight

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.660
effect here, you know, happening here where sure, we could have built this probably on a

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.120
number of different platforms and hosting services and tech stacks.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.880
But a big reason, I mean, for me personally, why I'm doing all this stuff, you know, why

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.120
I love being involved with the Python community and being able to teach in the Python community

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.920
is that I get to play with these things and build software in the way that I like to and

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.840
that I enjoy.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.540
So not everything is like a pure what is like the most effective or efficient way to do

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.820
this.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.980
So that's so interesting.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.200
You just made me realize I did the same thing, but unconsciously.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.260
So like, I knew nothing about deploying on Linux.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.860
So I feel like I originally tried going down the platform as a service route and like things

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.380
that would hold my hand as much as possible.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.360
And then I'm like, no, I feel like I need to know this.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.220
So I'm going to go force myself to use the infrastructure as a service thing and learn

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.660
Nginx and MicroWisgi and Linux and all these deployment things and how they work together.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.260
So that if I guess so, I wasn't be a weak spot for me or something.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.240
And I do feel like I took that on as like a learning challenge as much as a good way to

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:22.500
deploy.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.460
I think it also works really well, but like also to learn, right?

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.900
Like if you get a chance, totally.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.040
It's worth pointing out that you and I both run small businesses.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.500
We are not at a huge enterprise with somebody that has made rules about what tech we can

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:34.680
use.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.120
We can use anything long as like we're willing to live with the consequences, right?

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.420
And so at least personally, I use that as an opportunity to say, I want to use this tech

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.840
so I can learn it as well as I think it might be a good idea.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.080
Yeah.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.240
I think that's a big part of it.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.340
And then, I mean, also, you know, wouldn't it be a shame if the biggest Python podcast was

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.820
hosted on a bash script somewhere?

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.680
Like it's got to be built on Python.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.960
It's a Java app.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.740
Yeah, I guess nobody's questioning that decision, right?

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.900
To build the app in Python versus some other tech stack.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.020
Exactly.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.400
I kind of think like set the stage, we're running on Python, both of us.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.820
Let's start there, actually.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:16.000
That's an interesting case because when I started the podcast, I didn't want to start a Python

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.500
website.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.180
I wanted to start a podcast.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:26.020
And yet, I needed a website to serve the RSS feed and the MP3s so that I could have a podcast,

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:26.240
right?

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.920
Like it was table stakes.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.420
And right now, there are pretty decent options for hosting a podcast if you're willing to pay

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:32.800
a little bit.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.540
Like fireside.fm is not bad.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.780
Brian Okken uses that for testing code, for example.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.600
When I started Talk Python, there was a few options and they were bad options.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.120
Like they were not so good.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.080
So, I looked at that and I said, well, am I serious about this?

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.460
Like do I want a site that looks good and people will respond to?

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:54.420
Or is going to look like the worst WordPress theme you've ever seen?

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.980
But technically, it will be an RSS feed.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:57.760
And who cares?

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.820
You don't go to the website, right?

00:08:58.820 --> 00:08:59.100
Yeah.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:08:59.520
Yeah.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.900
I totally get that.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.440
And a lot of this stuff has changed also, I think.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.840
Because when did you start Talk Python training?

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.420
I started...

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.460
Or the podcast?

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.500
The podcast started in April 2015.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.300
The training site started in 2016 and February 15th.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.920
I know because that was my day I was free from full-time employment.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.220
Yeah.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:24.180
And so, you know, with all of this stuff, I think, especially in the podcasting space, you

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.020
know, a lot has changed.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.920
I mean, now it's sort of a legit thing like hosting a radio show.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.400
You know, my parents listen to podcasts and not my grandparents, right?

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.720
But like people know about that this is a thing.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.360
And when I think back, you know, even like three, four years ago, it wasn't at that level.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.600
I mean, even just looking at the apps, you know, I really like the Overcast app, for example.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.980
I don't think that was out back then.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.280
And, you know, it was just all like basically Apple, iTunes or something.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.220
And it's really changed and grown since then.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.960
So now there's probably all kinds of different options.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:57.100
But there's a lot of personal investment and all this like custom software that you've built.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.980
I mean, that we've both built for our businesses.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.000
And there's sort of also a barrier to move to something else.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.640
I feel like we sound super defensive talking about this stuff.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:19.160
Well, I think it's really interesting to consider like, should I have just said, no, I'm not going to build, say, for example, talk Python.fm and Python and build it myself and do the web design myself and all of that and figure out how RSS feeds and work.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.880
And how am I going to get the video or the audio delivered without like breaking the bank and bandwidth and all of that kind of stuff.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.700
Like I could have just put my credit card in at Podbean, got a crappy site for, you know, $5.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.180
I don't know what the price is or whatever.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.700
And just gone with that.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.540
But, you know, I felt like there's going to be a point where I want to do something that it doesn't do.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.320
And do I want to be walled off over there?

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:48.680
And also, it was a little bit of a learning experience, like you had said, like, oh, this will be to be a cool thing to run to understand how it all fits together.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.180
So I just understand it better.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:50.500
Yeah.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:55.540
But, you know, I would say like three months in, I never started the podcast thinking I would get sponsors.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.840
I thought that was a crazy idea.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:02.220
It would just be something that I could, you know, have a community of people I interact with because I didn't have that.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.720
But about three months in, one company approached me and said, hey, we would love to sponsor your show.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.800
It looks so nice and polished and professional compared to all the other stuff out there.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:17.100
And it's because all the other stuff was hosted in places that were like super cookie cutter and not so great.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.880
And I'm like, it started to feel like it paid off at that point.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.440
Like, oh, yeah.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.060
And I can like feature them in this way that wouldn't be possible if it were there.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:29.400
You know, like it slowed down the start, but it seems like it really paid off in a long term.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:29.700
Yeah.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.420
And that makes a lot of sense.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:37.540
And I just wanted to add to that, you know, also looking at my experience kind of building a custom tech stack.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:48.300
There's a huge element of survivorship bias in all of this where if you can pull it off and you can, you're successful with a custom solution, it's going to be awesome.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.320
It's going to make you unique and you're going to be able to build out all these unique features.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:12:02.520
But for every like 20 people who are trying to start a podcast of their own, there's going to be a lot of people who never make it to the actual recording because they're spending five months building their own infrastructure.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.440
I've been there, you know, not with a podcast, but with other stuff.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.220
That's a good thing to keep in mind for everything, right?

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:14.340
Like getting started is the most important thing in this journey for whatever you're doing, right?

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:23.220
I guess just to put a bow on that, like when I decided I'm going to try to build a site and see if I can make it work before I decided to host something else, host somewhere else.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.380
I started out on a Friday.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.860
I said, all right, done with work.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.440
I really want to create this thing.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.380
I'm going to just go all in on this weekend.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.940
And by Monday morning, it was like live and beautiful and ready.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.920
And so it was like, I'm willing to try a couple of days to see if doing it myself is crazy or not.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.600
And then I would have maybe gone and, you know, paid a couple bucks to Podbean or whatever, right?

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.900
I wouldn't have waited three months before I even tried the podcasting side of the thing.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.240
It was like, this is exciting.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:50.860
Let me try it.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:51.960
And if it works, I'll go with it.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.760
Otherwise, I'll pull a ripcord and do something else.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:53.980
Yeah.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:54.220
Yeah.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.340
Like do a little experiment and then see how far you can get.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:56.560
Yeah.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.000
Yeah.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.040
Yeah, exactly.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:04.400
So maybe, I don't know, maybe it's worth talking a little bit about the just quick fly over the tech stack.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:04.840
What do you think?

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.100
Yeah, I think it'd be interesting.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.680
I mean, how do you want to slice and dice this?

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:14.740
Like maybe we should talk about like, first of all, what are the main services that you run for your podcast?

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.580
And you've got the training site and all these other things.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:16.600
Right.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.340
Because they all have different goals and constraints and whatever, right?

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:31.360
For example, the training site demands low latency video delivery where the podcast site, it doesn't matter at all if that's delivered a little slower because it auto refreshes on your app and you just open it and it's there.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:31.860
Yeah.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:32.460
So let's see.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.720
I have talkpython.fm, which is the website.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.680
And let's just group the audio delivery in for that one.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.880
I have pythonbytes.fm that I do with Brian and it's audio delivery.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.980
And I've got the training site.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:52.180
The Talk Python site and the Python Bytes site have custom search engines that I have as REST endpoints.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.380
So search.talkpython.fm, for example.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.660
You can consume that and search that if you want.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.400
And internally, the site uses that so you can search for stuff and whatnot.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.440
Same for Python Bytes.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.600
So there's kind of that side of things and the audio delivery there.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.460
And then there's the training site.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:17.340
And the training site is actually a lot more complicated, I would say, on the infrastructure side because it's got to deliver the videos.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.060
It's got to do e-commerce.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.520
It has a bunch of accounts.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.320
But also it has to have the video delivery, low latency, anywhere in the world.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.780
It has the apps, right?

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:32.000
Now it has the apps, the iOS and Android apps around it and so on.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.620
So, yeah, that's probably the landscape.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.480
Also…

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.200
Your mobile apps.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.220
Yeah, inbound, outbound, email.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:43.860
We've got a bunch of services there, like the video stuff, right?

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.600
So when we record the videos, we don't release what we record.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:56.040
We have to transform it into certain formats that work well in like iOS and are minimized in their like video size based relative to, say,

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:56.580
the resolution.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:00.720
And there's like all that processing pipeline is pretty interesting as well.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.440
Yeah, this is super cool.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.680
I mean, it's kind of mind-blowing, you know, to go over this and sit down and really tease it apart.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.360
Like what are even all the services that you run?

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.800
Because it's so much stuff, right?

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.200
People would…

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:11.900
Isn't it just a podcast?

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.000
I thought this myself.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.340
Yeah, you know, it's a podcast.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.040
So what do you need, you know, a laptop to record this?

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:17.760
Like we're sitting here.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.500
It's kind of a nice and minimal setup.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:28.920
But there's a lot of infrastructure that is powering all this stuff so that your listeners get to enjoy this on their commute and in their cars.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:38.700
I mean, just to give people a sense, like a while ago, I sort of summed up all the data usage, bandwidth usage of my various servers and whatnot between the database and then the audio.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.040
Not even counting the videos, which are their own special thing.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.780
And I think it was running at like 17 terabytes of traffic a month.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.140
Oh, wow.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.140
It's a lot of Python.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.300
It's a lot of Python.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.520
It's a lot of Python.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.300
So, yeah, it's pretty cool.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.020
It's actually pretty awesome to see.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:53.600
Amazing.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.820
Okay, so this makes us even harder to kind of slice and dice this and dive into the most interesting bits.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:07.400
I know one of the things that you and I have had some conversations about is the whole like, you know, monolith versus microservices and most recently also the serverless approach.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:16.960
And I think it would be interesting to talk about that a little bit because I feel like now there's sort of a return to the monolith in the industry where people got burned by the server.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.420
Yeah.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.020
Yeah.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.520
The pendulum has swung a little backwards, right?

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.820
So, I felt a little uncool, to be honest, a couple of years ago.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:25.120
Same here.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.380
Because people are like, dude, how are your microservices working?

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.280
I'm like, well, there's three services, right?

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:38.340
There's, say, talkpython.fm and then it also has like the search service and then it has an audio delivery bit that's like a little bit separate.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.060
But that's not really microservices so much, right?

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.080
Microservices are way more small grained, certainly.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.560
You know, and talkbython training is like definitely a monolith.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.720
But I try to have a really pragmatic view of these things.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.260
Like, I'm not Google.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.420
I'm not Facebook.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.140
I'm not LinkedIn, as Brian likes to say, right?

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.920
Like, why do I need to trade that off?

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.740
And I guess in this context, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:14.760
But when I think of like the, should it be a microservice or should it be more monolith, it feels to me like what I'm doing is taking the complexity and moving it from code complexity in a monolith to operational complexity in a bunch of services.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:20.900
I'm better suited naturally with my experience to handle code complexity than DevOps complexity.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:28.320
If I was maybe really good at DevOps complexity and not so good at code, maybe I would have chosen microservices, but that wasn't where my capabilities were.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.780
So I'm like, I'm going to play to my strengths here and just stick with this.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.020
Yeah.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:35.260
Which I think that is the best solution if you're running a small business.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.600
And I mean, in our case, we're both building all of the software ourselves.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:38.940
Yeah.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:45.620
And we're basically the CEO and CTO and main chief account of all this stuff in one person.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:54.640
And so I think especially then to go down a route of adding a lot of complexity, like operational complexity early on is not a good place to be.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.000
And like what I found really inspiring is Basecamp as a company.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.500
I mean, there used to be 37 signals.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.480
I love their stuff.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.500
I used to read like Getting Started, their book religiously.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.500
Yeah.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:04.900
Yeah.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.520
And it's, you know, it's really good, really good books.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:16.040
And I think also really, just a really, really inspiring company and really good or like really interesting from a tech stack perspective too, because they're totally going down the monolith route.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:23.480
I mean, their CTO is basically the inventor or creator of the Ruby on Rails framework, which is pretty much like Django in the Python world.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:36.920
And they're purposefully building software using monolithic approach so that they can be effective with a small team, which is ultimately if you're running a one person or two person business, super important.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.260
Like, I mean, you want that.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.800
That 20% efficiency or whatever is massive when you're small.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.480
When you're a huge company, huge companies are massively inefficient, like from my experience.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.440
So that's pretty interesting.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.940
I'm definitely a fan of just having things working simply and knowing that you can change it, right?

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.240
We could break it into microservices if we need to, but yeah, same.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.920
And I feel like just serverless is just like that, but plus more.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.300
Like it's more pieces I got to manage.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.600
And so until I need it, I feel like I'm going to stick with what I'm doing.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:06.900
Yeah.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.200
Yeah.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:12.340
And to me, it's interesting also that, you know, your search service is a separate thing.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:16.240
So you're, it's almost a little bit of a hybrid model there for you.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:16.880
Yeah, a little bit.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.920
Where, and I think the Python bytes, that's a separate.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.620
That's a separate app, right?

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.460
And it's similar for me where real pythons are a separate app, right?

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:27.060
And it's similar for me where realpython.com is like a monolithic web app, but then we

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:32.980
have this feedback form system that's separate or the PyCoders weekly newsletter that I run

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.320
is also a separate application.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:40.760
And I think it makes sense to kind of slice things up this way because then you can treat

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.580
those systems in isolation.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.860
And I guess the question is just, you know, when, I think it's a spectrum of like monolith

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:51.720
to microservice to let's say serverless, maybe it was like really, really tiny microservices

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.120
basically.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:56.740
And so, I mean, we're both not running pure monoliths, right?

00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.140
In that sense where if it was a pure monolith, like everything you have, like the podcast

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.700
and all the APIs, the search.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.060
It would be one single thing.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:04.580
Yeah.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:04.780
Yeah.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:09.560
I have eight different servers that are participating in like all the stuff we described at the beginning.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:15.160
So maybe I don't know when it is a microservices architecture versus when is it a monolithic

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:15.720
architecture?

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.620
Because I mean, you basically have a search microservice in that sense, right?

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.060
So I've always been struggling with those terms a little bit.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:22.280
Yeah.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.160
I think there's two driving forces.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:30.120
One would be technical and the other would be sort of team personal based.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.860
Like, is there a technical reason to have those two things separate?

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.680
Do you want to consume them separately?

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.400
Should they be versioned separately?

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.460
Should they live on separate servers?

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.480
Things like that.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:44.620
That's maybe a technical thing that'll push you into this mini microservice light?

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.800
Microservice light?

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.120
I don't know whatever you call it, right?

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.100
We're going to term.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:54.320
And then the other one is, do you have people who are not experienced with the whole thing,

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.080
but maybe they could work on the search service, right?

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.560
Like if I had somebody who was like a junior developer who came on and I was going to have

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.980
them work on the search service for a month, like it's not really worth it and it's not

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.480
that big, but imagine it were, right?

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.680
Like it might make sense to have that separate.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.060
They can deploy it and live with it.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.020
And if they take down the search service, it's not the end of the world.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:14.600
You know what I mean?

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.460
But if they take down the main site, like all of a sudden it's a problem potentially.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:23.660
And so I feel like certainly microservices are easier for different teams to work on different

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.960
bits or different people to work on simpler bits.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.520
But like you said, we're mostly doing the software development ourself.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.320
And so that's absolutely not a pressure that is applied to our stuff.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:34.660
Yeah.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:39.520
I think that's a good point where you want the ability for one of those services to go down.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.700
Like if it's an experimental new thing that you built, let's say like the search and you're

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:48.220
playing with the or working on the search feature, trying to make it better in some way, you want

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:52.040
to gracefully degrade the experience for everybody who's using the website.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.780
Maybe search doesn't work, but everything else would still work.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:59.100
I did that, for example, when I built like an ad serving, like an ethical ads platform for

00:21:59.100 --> 00:21:59.960
realpython.com.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.660
And it's now also used on PyCoders Weekly and some other sites.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.640
And there was the same thing where it's like, you know, I don't really know if I'm going to

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.900
be running this thing in a couple of months.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:08.980
It's more an experiment.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:14.260
And instead of kind of polluting my monolithic code base with that new thing, I'd rather have

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:14.740
it separate.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.740
And so I could also scale it independently.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.720
So I'm wondering if that also factors into your decisions, like maybe search needs to be

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.800
scaled differently or one of these sites is going to grow faster than the other ones.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.440
Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:30.740
Like if you need to scale one part a lot, it's easy to just scale that tier or put a load balancer

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.340
in front of that.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:37.040
Also, it's running under different core domains and different SSL certificates and stuff.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.720
So maybe that makes it a little easier to have it separate, like search.talkpython.fm, not

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.540
 talkpython.fm/search.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:44.760
Although that's kind of maybe minor.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.040
I could change that around.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.900
But yeah, it's certainly a consideration.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:53.320
This portion of Talk Python to me is brought to you by Linode.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.060
Are you looking for hosting that's fast, simple, and incredibly affordable?

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:01.240
Well, look past that bookstore and check out Linode at talkpython.fm.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.160
Slash Linode.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.040
That's L-I-N-O-D-E.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.480
Plans start at just $5 a month for a dedicated server with a gig of RAM.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.680
They have 10 data centers across the globe.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.500
So no matter where you are or where your users are, there's a data center for you.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:19.000
Whether you want to run a Python web app, host a private Git server, or just a file server,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.800
you'll get native SSDs on all the machines, a newly upgraded 200 gigabit network, 24-7 friendly

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.940
support even on holidays, and a seven-day money-back guarantee.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.560
Need a little help with your infrastructure?

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:35.300
They even offer professional services to help you with architecture, migrations, and more.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.240
Do you want a dedicated server for free for the next four months?

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.300
Just visit talkpython.fm/Linode.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:47.940
One of the differences between both of our setups there that I'm personally really interested in

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:53.280
is that for the hosting aspects of the infrastructure, we're using different approaches.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:53.900
Absolutely.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:59.660
The way I understand it, you will actually provision an individual virtual server and then run an

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:00.560
application on that.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.540
Let's say Python Bytes has its own virtual machine somewhere in the cloud.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:08.400
I'm more like the infrastructure as a service model, whereas most of my stuff runs on platform

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.940
as a service providers like Heroku.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.960
I don't provision my own Linux server and keep it updated.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.140
I just kind of offload that.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:19.360
And so I'm really interested in how the infrastructure as a service model is working for you.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.360
If you ever considered switching, for example, or if you see some benefits in it.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:23.520
It's working pretty well.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.860
I feel like I've definitely gained a lot of experience that I wouldn't have, right?

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:33.600
Like, give me 15 minutes, I could set up a new HTTPS service on Nginx backed by some, you know,

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.060
MicroWiz gear, GPU record or something.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.120
And having like that experience, DevOps experience, I think is nice.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:44.320
I think the way I kind of got there was a little bit of that learning and exploration stuff.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.940
I kind of wanted to have that as a skill set.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.080
So like, let me try it.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:53.860
And, you know, when I started, it was like $10, two $5 servers, one for the database.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.800
Maybe it might have just been one, right?

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.340
Like on the same server even or something.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.680
But it was like really just a quick little easy way to get started.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.440
And it worked really well for me.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.120
I'm like, this thing is just perfect.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:04.480
It works.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.400
It's up all the time.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:05.920
I love it.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.740
As things have grown, it's gotten a little more complicated.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.600
And I feel like I'm still really happy the way it is.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.900
But it's sort of taken on its own life a little bit to have.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.020
Because you're provisioning your own databases, right?

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.780
You're not going like, oh, Amazon, I need to.

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.860
So the way I have it set up is I have MongoDB as my server.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.660
I didn't start with MongoDB, but I have it.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.720
And I have the different services.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:32.220
And they have all different databases, but they all are on the same database server, right?

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:37.560
So all the main sites, training.talkpython.fm, Talk Python itself, Python Bytes,

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.620
they all have their main server in like a load balance failover server.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:46.800
So if I got a reboot or do maintenance, I can just like automatically through Python with an API.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:54.240
Like as part of the deployment stack, what happened or flow, it'll switch it to this other super, super cheap cloud server,

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.000
handle the traffic well enough while it's off, and then switch it back.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:58.740
Right?

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:04.840
But all of those share a central MongoDB virtual machine that's like, instead of having a bunch of small ones,

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.920
I bought like one high, high performance one and they just share it.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.120
Yeah.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:08.420
Yeah.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.200
And it's fine.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.320
I mean, like if you go log into the MongoDB server and you pull up in load and you say,

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.660
what is the traffic on this server?

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:22.000
Like the average bandwidth is about eight to nine megabits per second continuously.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.480
So it's getting a lot of work.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.540
But if you pull up the CPU usage, it's one to 2%.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:27.140
Yeah.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:31.060
I mean, it's like, it could take way, way more of what it's getting than it does.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.460
So why did I choose that?

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.120
Why don't I go on Heroku or something like that?

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.960
I feel like what I got is already working.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.840
I'm really happy with the way it works.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.100
I can make it do just what I want.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:46.040
Any change that I want to make, I feel like the sky's the limit, right?

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.560
I want to change how Nginx works.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:47.980
Fine.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.740
I want to make it serve HTTP2 for this part, but not for that.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:51.600
I can totally do that.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.560
Did you ever have like some incident with the database, let's say,

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.060
where you have to rebuild it from scratch or restore it?

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.560
I've never had any problem.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:04.060
The database, it's been that configuration, let's say, for about two and a half years.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.980
I've never had it go down or get corrupted.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:16.080
What I have had is the network infrastructure inside the hosting, inside the host has had issues.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:21.800
So the things couldn't find the server, but that wasn't the server process fault or the machine.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:26.640
It was like the glue was broken for a little, but that's still, you know, like a couple minutes

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.080
if you sum it up over all those years.

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:33.920
The thing that makes this challenging that you avoid, which I want to hear your side of this here in a second,

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:39.880
is I can manage all this stuff, but I'm not running MongoDB in a replica cluster,

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:46.200
which would be the way for like true 100% availability because the changes that I need to make to it are like incredibly small.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:53.980
But about once a month, there's a 10 second downtime because the underlying server has security patches.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:54.340
Yeah.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.800
And so I got to reboot the thing that is the center of that hub.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.160
Yeah.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.580
And so I've actually built stuff into say Talk Python, the training site, for example,

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:07.240
that I'll flip a switch to say the app is in off mode and every request will send you over to a page that says,

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.220
we're doing a major upgrade, please hold on.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:14.940
And it has a meta tag that refreshes every five seconds and it notices when the database switchbacks on,

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.060
it takes them back to the page they tried to get to.

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:17.560
Come on, man.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.320
That's not good enough.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.040
We need eight nines.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:29.920
Now, I realize like some people have to have 100% availability, but for my world, like 10 seconds downtime per month is acceptable, right?

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:30.640
I don't know.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.900
That's the way I have it set up.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.920
Tell us about what you're doing at RealPython because I get a lot of traffic.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.220
I maybe do more pure bandwidth because I have audio in large quantities.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:39.380
I think you do.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:40.300
Pretty sure you do.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.920
But you definitely do more requests.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:48.400
I probably get under two or three million HTTP requests that are data-driven Python requests,

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.020
not static files and whatever, per month if I add them all up across all the things.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.280
But I'm sure that you get quite a bit more.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.100
So you're running a totally different setup.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.040
Tell us how that goes.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:03.940
The setup that I use for RealPython, like all the other stuff like the Ethical Ads platform, PyCoders,

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.080
pretty much all runs on Heroku these days.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.680
And the downside is it's a lot more expensive than provisioning your own box.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:16.580
But the upside is that, you know, recently I was going on my first vacation in like a really, really long time.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:21.500
And my wife and I were going on this hike and we're coming back to civilization.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.000
Very far away from a computer.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.220
Very far away from a computer.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.680
Of course, I brought the computer.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.620
Yeah, so did I.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.040
I'd never go about it just in case.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.380
We're coming back from a site.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.980
And I checked my phone and there's like 50 Slack messages.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.380
Not 50, but, you know, it's like Slack is on fire.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.880
Like the real Python Slack is on fire.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:40.360
And I checked my email and there's like all these exception tracebacks.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.840
And I'm like, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.300
And it looks like the database passed.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.680
You know, some issue with the database.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.900
That service has just disappeared.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.240
And then I keep reading further down.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:55.620
And I get this email from my hosting provider, from Heroku, from where we have the database set up.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:30:00.560
And the way it works is you just say, okay, you know, I want the Postgres database, this version with this many rows of capacity.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:07.120
And you get that box provisioned and they do all the backups and they provide an automatic failover and all of that.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:13.640
And so I scroll down the emails further and I'm like, oh, okay, they detected that five minutes ago and already switched over to the failover automatically.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.120
And then reprovisioned the master and kind of switched it back.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.580
And I didn't have to do anything.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:24.940
And it totally saved me probably like at least an afternoon of work while the website would have been down.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.360
And not a regular afternoon of work.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:26.980
A vacation.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.240
Sorry, honey, we were going to be on the beach.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.740
Because now I'm in the hotel frantically fighting this bad internet afternoon of work.

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:34.060
Exactly.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.920
And so I was like, oh man, this is great.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.020
I very much like that.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:46.540
And so I was always a bit worried that something really bad would happen from a hosting perspective if I was going to start provisioning all my own boxes and then updating them.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:50.200
This is a constant fear of mine of just like what happens if it just goes down.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.300
It hasn't been a problem yet, but that doesn't prove anything.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.500
It's just it hasn't happened yet.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:54.940
Right.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:55.460
Yeah, totally.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.040
It's a real fear that I also have all the time.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:58.160
Yeah.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:58.440
Yeah.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:58.780
Yeah.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:30:59.500
It's pretty interesting.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.260
But you're pretty happy with the platform as a service?

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:08.540
I'm really happy with it just from a usability friendliness perspective as a developer because I don't have to worry about installing.

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:12.840
When the whole Spectre thing happened and all of these interesting...

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:13.180
Oh, yeah.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.320
We had that 10 second downtime for a lot of reasons.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:16.820
Yeah.

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:16.820
Yeah.

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:17.140
Yeah.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:17.320
Yeah.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.000
Yeah.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:18.080
Yeah.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:24.600
You know, I didn't really have to do anything about it because I just basically tell the platform, like, here's the code for the app.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.980
Here's the services that I need.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.360
So I need like Redis as a cache.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.240
I need Postgres as the database.

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:35.460
And just give me an endpoint that I can talk to or like credentials for the database.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:39.460
And they will keep it patched and updated and make sure there's backups.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.940
And there's like, it's always like a failover primary, secondary system.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:47.920
And I very much like the sense of security it gives me.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:52.360
But on the other hand, I mean, it's probably fairly unlikely that your server will just melt down.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.220
And so what are you really getting?

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.120
You know, maybe it's worth the trade-off.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:56.580
Yeah.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:03.240
I mean, you're already protected of hardware failures on the IaaS systems because they'll move your VM across.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:09.240
I've had several times the underlying machine has died and we moved your VM over somewhere else.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:09.460
Yeah.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.060
And it just kept rolling.

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:16.260
Have you ever considered like running your podcast on real, like bare metal in your living room, in your office room?

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:16.620
No.

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:19.060
I'll tell you a funny story really quickly.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.700
Slight diversion, but I think it's worth it.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:25.600
So this is from 19, I remember where I was.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.320
This is like 95, 1994, 95.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:33.420
I remember like the first Mozilla browser came out in 93.

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:38.200
So I had a friend who was a web designer friend.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.420
And this predates all the like hosting.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:40.900
Yeah.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.160
I mean, this is like a couple of years in the internet.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.720
And he somehow, I have been thinking back, I have no idea how he did this.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:54.020
He had gotten the job to build the website of one of the major helicopter manufacturers in the world.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:54.440
Wow.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:54.740
Right?

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:59.940
And he was hosting, he was hosting all of his sites on his laptop in his house.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:08.860
But, but we had a party at his house and somebody walked by and tripped on the power cord and unplugged it.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:10.200
But it didn't turn off right away.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:10.400
Right.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.400
Cause it just went to battery.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.000
Yeah.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.400
But a few hours later that ran out of battery and it turned off and he went to sleep.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.280
He woke up the next day and people were upset.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.500
Like, why is the website?

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:19.200
Oh no.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.300
We had a server failure is what he told him.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.940
But it was, we had a party and someone pulled the cord on the laptop.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:24.700
Is that insane?

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.280
Would that ever happen now?

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.420
Yeah.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:31.240
It goes to show like how much this, this whole industry has changed.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.960
I mean, maybe that's what they're doing at Heroku.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.420
I don't know.

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.160
It's like in somebody's basement.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:36.880
Yeah.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.200
No, I would never, I would never consider on like bare metal.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:46.520
Like there's just having the failover at the network level and just the bandwidth and the

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.440
flexibility, the geolocations, right?

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.460
Like I think a lot about where stuff located for different purposes.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:56.640
That's going to be interesting too, to chat about that aspect because I know that for the

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.100
video delivery, for the courses, you're doing some really interesting stuff.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:03.080
Like basically you built your own little, like not little, but like a content delivery network

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:07.960
to be like physically close to the person that's watching the video.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:13.360
The first thing I hear when I talk to people about this is you're not just using a CDN and

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.320
I'm sure I'm going to hear some stuff about this again, because it's irresistible.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.040
It seems to talk about it, but I'm not using CDN.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.340
I'm using something else that lets me create, have more control over the visibility of the

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:27.980
URLs and the content, because I don't want to have just public content, even if it's sort

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.460
of protected on the app side.

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.580
It's like once you have URLs, they're just public, right?

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.560
So I have a way to like create signed short-term URLs.

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.200
But yeah, the video delivery is really important.

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.120
So that doesn't happen out of my servers.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.140
That happens out of other places throughout the world.

00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:42.380
So I have like eight locations.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:47.080
Like there's a site in Mumbai, there's one in Sydney, there's one in Tokyo, there's one

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.680
in Ohio, right?

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.140
Where we are here and so on.

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:54.980
And so when you go to training.talkpython.fm and you play a video, not the little marketing

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:59.720
videos, but like all the other real content, the first question the site asks is, who are

00:34:59.720 --> 00:34:59.920
you?

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.480
Are you logged in?

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.280
Are you allowed to do this?

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.060
The answer is yes.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.840
Then the next one is, where are you?

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:04.740
Right?

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:10.620
So it'll figure out what of the servers that it has available to it, which one is closest

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:11.020
to you.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:15.460
And then it'll, it'll stream it to you from that location, wherever you happen to be.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:15.960
Nice.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:16.320
Yeah.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.940
And then to get it in those locations.

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:20.820
I've got one place I upload to.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:27.980
And then this little system, a little like unit, a system unit from system D Python thing

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.680
that runs continuously on one of the servers.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:36.320
And anytime it sees a change to like the main location, it'll synchronize it throughout the other seven places in the world.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.760
So, you know, upload it to one place, walk away, you know, seven minutes, a few minutes

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.340
later, like it's in the different seven locations.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:42.620
Yeah.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:47.900
So the crazy thing to me here is that, that you're also doing your own video transcoding

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:51.380
and all of these things to be able to deliver to the app and to different browsers.

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.000
And yeah.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.900
Well, I tried to just publish the Camtasia videos and they wouldn't play on iOS.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.320
And then they were too big in other places and stuff.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:03.000
And you've got to have certain underlying, like it's not good enough.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
It's just an MP4.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:04.320
Yeah.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:09.140
It's got to have like this version or like these settings, or it can't be over like 1.5

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.280
megabit encodings for certain things.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.400
And it's super painful.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.660
And so actually shout out to Cecil Phillip.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:16.880
He pointed me towards this.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:23.280
So what I found and started using, I mean, obviously it's, you know, been around is Amazon

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.580
has something called elastic transcoder service.

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:26.840
All right.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:32.200
So elastic transcoder service lets you come up with a very carefully structured set of transformations

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:37.140
to your video and you give it a video and it'll generate that, like give it a five minute

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.820
video and 20 seconds.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:42.020
And you have like an output that is perfect for streaming on the other devices.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:48.960
So I wrote a Python script that'll go to a set of like a course videos folder, run it.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.200
It'll take all the videos.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.660
It'll upload them to a temporary location in S3.

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:56.840
And then it'll use the API to talk to the transcoder service and have it drop into another

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.060
location in S3 when it's done.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.820
And then when it's done, it'll grab it, download it, put it in a different spot on my stuff.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:06.340
And just here's like the sort of streaming version of that course you just built.

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.240
It's awesome.

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:10.400
It still seems crazy to me, but I mean, I know that you're a really good engineer.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.940
And the fact that you can pull this off, I think is really, really amazing.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.060
When you told me about this the first time, I just thought it was mind blowing.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.900
Because I was like, I'm just going to use Vimeo.

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.140
Well, here's the thing.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.240
I started out with Vimeo.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.700
I started out using Vimeo.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.820
And it was really good until it wasn't good enough.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.180
Right?

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:33.740
Like Vimeo was good, but it would periodically, like the embedded player stuff would stop working,

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:37.160
you know, and it'd be down for like 15 minutes.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.780
It'd be like, you know, I'd start getting emails.

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.160
Michael's site's down.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.000
I'm like, yeah, I know.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.600
But it's 100% out of my control.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.900
Then I would get questions like, hey, can I play this at 1.5 speed?

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:48.480
Like, no.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.880
Player doesn't do 1.5.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.720
It doesn't have speed.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.400
So, no, I'm not.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.160
I can't do that.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.420
Just on and on.

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.340
Can I have an offline version or whatever?

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:55.640
Right?

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:59.840
Like there's all these things that you start to want and they eventually pile up.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.060
And you're just like, okay, well, if not that, then what?

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:03.620
Right?

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.440
Because it was working mostly great.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.540
But then it's like, all right, well, now it gets really complicated really quickly.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.440
But, you know, it didn't start that way, right?

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.100
Like I was selling the courses.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.040
Things were going great.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:20.740
And then like I needed more than I could get from that sort of pro setup I had,

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:23.420
like the pro account or the business account I had set up with them.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:26.020
I'm like, all right, that's, you know, thank you for your service.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.640
But it's time for me to move on and do something else.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.760
And by the way, this is way more expensive, right?

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.140
Like I'm paying for the bandwidth.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:32.440
Oh, yeah.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:32.960
Oh, I better do so.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.480
And the transcoder is pretty cheap.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.620
It's like $10 to transcode like hours of video or something.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.160
And you do that once, but the bandwidth is more.

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:45.700

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:38.840
So would you say the fact that this also makes your offering unique, your website is unique,

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:44.720
sort of like a bespoke design, build it from scratch, like the search, all of that stuff is unique.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.940
It makes you special.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:49.580
And it makes, I think, as a visitor or reader, follower, consumer,

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:54.120
it feels different to go on one of your websites than like a run-of-the-mill WordPress site.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.840
So is this something that sort of happened organically or is this something that that was your goal initially?

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:03.140
I would say it somewhat happened organically, but it was also somewhat of a goal,

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:05.220
like especially around the training stuff.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.380
Like there were a lot of options.

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:10.640
Like I could have used Teachable or Thinkrific or Udemy,

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:15.900
or I could have partnered up with Pluralsight or one of those sets of people, right?

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:16.980
Those types of platforms.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:23.580
And the consideration there was this is like my bet on my future.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:28.120
And this is the most important thing I consider that I'm doing for the next couple of years.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.940
I want it to be as nice as it can be.

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:34.380
I know I can build a better site than Thinkful or whatever, Teachable, these different places.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:42.520
And I think it'll be more special if it's not just under some subscription place like Pluralsight or Safari Online or whatever, right?

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:49.660
And so I actually thought as hard as I could, like, is there a way I can avoid doing this, right?

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:50.700
Because I really don't want to.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:51.520
It's getting in my way.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.860
It's going to take me like weeks.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.000
Like that actually took a long time.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.700
It was like almost a month to write the site and all that stuff.

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:05.280
But in the end, I decided, you know, if I just do it like a band-aid, just pull it off, do it now, I'll be in a better place, you know?

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:14.240
And like keep in mind, this is like, this is the decision I had to make like the day I quit my job and I had no income and I could have no income until that was done, right?

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.800
It wasn't just like, oh, maybe I'll evolve it, whatever.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.000
That gets you motivated, yeah.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.300
Yeah, that'll get you going.

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.420
Like you'll get it written quick.

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:26.240
You know, when I think back, like we've been chatting about this stuff for a long time, right?

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:26.600
Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.920
Developing our stuff there in parallel.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:33.140
And you've sort of drawn me into that direction more to do more custom stuff.

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.040
We had a real similar debate, right?

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:40.640
You're like, I could probably just set up some WordPress thing and make this happen like for real Python or whatever it was you were doing at the time.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:46.900
My first Python education website, debater.org, which is still around, sort of my personal thing there.

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:52.200
That was a custom, sort of like a static site generator, but it was just all serving it from memory.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.240
So it was like written in the BottlePy framework.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:59.180
And, you know, way back when I wrote it in 2012, I didn't really know what I was doing, to be honest.

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.540
So it's kind of limping along.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:11.560
And when I had the chance to do things properly with real Python, I was sort of torn between, oh, I would love to do something custom.

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:15.660
But I also know that there's downsides to it in the long run.

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.660
It's like a constant friction that is on you.

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:25.800
Like I would say I spend at least 10% of my time just keeping things running and smooth and adapted.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:29.860
Like it doesn't, I don't know why, but it seems like there's always just a little bit of friction.

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.900
And you wouldn't have that necessarily with the other stuff, right?

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:32.160
Yeah.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.720
Well, it's or so you would think, right?

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.720
I guess so you would think.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.500
I was talking to a lot of people just in the web dev space.

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.000
And, you know, I used to work as a backend engineer for a company in Vancouver.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.020
And shout out to Mobilify, a really cool company.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:46.900
And my friends were pushing towards like, oh, just use WordPress.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:49.740
You know, you can get all the plugins if you want to hire somebody.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:53.420
There's a lot of people who know about WordPress and PHP versus Python.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.740
You can buy a theme, you know, there's like this whole ecosystem for this stuff.

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.920
And, you know, back then I think we had a similar conversation about this.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.460
And we're like, you know, you should really consider doing a custom implementation because

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.260
then you can tailor it exactly the way you want to.

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:12.620
And I'm so glad I changed my mind or partially you convinced me and that I rewrote realpython.com

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:17.540
as a Django app because now it is sort of a superpower being able to have a really tailored

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:23.280
and unique workflow for all the authors contributing to the site, you know, for our editing team

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.580
and just to be able to, you know, run something like a little linter on an article.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.160
And I don't have to A, write that in PHP.

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:34.040
And then B, I think the other thing is as soon as you get, so for example, my wife's website,

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.640
she has a graphic design portfolio.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:39.220
We built that on WordPress and that's cool and all.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:44.300
You're so effective and fast in the beginning, but then you start running into all these issues

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.820
with these plugins playing together.

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:48.620
And maybe you don't even fully understand the underlying tech.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.620
Like you can jump into Python and fix it.

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.760
Like, can you actually resolve that problem with PHP?

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:53.640
Yeah, no.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.960
No, me either.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.080
Some people, yes, but me, no.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:57.760
Yeah.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:58.060
Yeah.

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.680
And that's a big pain now where it's like, well, you know, this plugin is getting updated

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.020
and then there's like a new big new release or some security patch.

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:08.560
And these things are not all updating in sync and they're kind of all doing their own thing.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.820
And it blows up a lot.

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:14.720
Whereas if you run your own application, you have a lot of control over the deployment process

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.020
also.

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:19.860
And so like in retrospect now, I'm really glad that it's a custom Python app.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.080
Yeah.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:20.640
Yeah.

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.080
That's awesome.

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:24.420
I guess the question is, how are we all going to feel about this in five years from now

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:27.260
where it's like, oh God, you've got to maintain this thing.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.340
Actually, this brings me to another question that we haven't really touched on yet.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.760
Like choice of Python web dev frameworks.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:33.160
Yeah.

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:34.940
So you're using Pyramid, right?

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:35.260
Yeah.

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:36.760
I'm using Pyramid and you're using Django.

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:37.460
For the most part.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:37.620
Yeah.

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:37.880
Django.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.360
For the most part.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:38.500
Yeah.

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:43.660
I'm also using a little bit of Flask for some APIs that people don't see, but they're there.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:43.940
Yeah.

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:48.960
It's got some BottlePy in there still for debater.org, but everything else is Flask.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:49.500
Yeah.

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:50.920
So that's an interesting one.

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:54.300
You know, there's two things that I really, really liked about Pyramid.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:57.040
And keep in mind, this is 2015, not 2019.

00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:59.200
When I decided these things, right?

00:44:59.200 --> 00:44:59.460
Yeah.

00:44:59.460 --> 00:44:59.660
Yeah.

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:03.020
So at least for one of them, one's unchanged, one's true.

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:10.060
For when I went, like my personal web style is like a minimalist, bring the little pieces

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:10.260
together.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:11.880
I'm kind of a micro framework type person.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:15.920
So I thought Django is nice, but it feels like kind of bigger.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:18.040
I need to understand more of it at once.

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:22.560
And I felt like with the micro frameworks, I could like learn it piece by piece.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.600
You know, like I'm going to understand this little part here.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.700
And like, I don't know what that does.

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:26.380
I don't need to know.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.900
I mean, that's actually on the Pyramid framework site.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:33.700
Like one of their principles is you can be effective with a partial understanding of Pyramid.

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:34.600
Like I can call it.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.080
So anyway, so I was considering Pyramid.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.240
I was considering Flask and a few other things.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:46.540
But when I, at the time, super underscore that, at the time I went to the Flask website and

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:48.560
said, this is for Python 2.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.380
It may, may work on Python 3.

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:52.960
Your mileage may vary.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.740
We have no guarantees for you there.

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:56.380
Right.

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.580
And I'm like, whoa.

00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:00.080
I don't know if I want to get into that.

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:00.260
Right.

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:03.080
Like I don't want to start a brand new thing on Python 2.

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:04.900
If like that's its world.

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:10.280
I did a quick check of the performance stuff and Pyramid was faster than the other two on Python 3.

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:13.840
I think Flask was faster on Python 2, but that didn't make me happy.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:14.600
Right.

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.600
I want to be on Python 3.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.720
So, you know, having no legacy code, I'm like, all right, let me try this Pyramid thing.

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.240
The other reason I really like Pyramid is the Chameleon templates.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:27.520
Like I very much dislike the style of the Jinja templates.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:32.000
And it's not just Jinja, you know, C# has the Razor space that's very similar.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.520
Django's templates are similar.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:38.260
What I don't like is template languages that are very much not HTML.

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:45.500
Like you can't take a Jinja template and load it in a standard HTML editor and have it think it's okay.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:45.860
Right.

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:52.020
Because you've got that angle bracket percent for something, something like their angle bracket percent and for all over the place.

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:52.220
Right.

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:58.520
Whereas Chameleon is more angular or view like, like Vue.js, like where it's attribute driven.

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:05.360
So you might have an attribute that is not understood, but that's valid HTML other than tal colon condition has a string.

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:05.560
Right.

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.180
Right.

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:08.100
It's like, I don't know what attribute means, but it's valid HTML.

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.840
Oh, does it actually like parse the template as XML or whatever?

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.260
And then like, it makes sure that it's valid.

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.280
Yes, it does.

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.620
Because if you have an unclosed tag, it freaks.

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:17.220
That is cool.

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:17.700
I had no idea.

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:17.980
Yeah.

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:21.940
It's like true HTML that's like extended by Python.

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:26.280
And also it's more, you can't write arbitrary Python code there.

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.800
You have to like have a little better architectural separation.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:33.120
Those two things, when I got started, I'm like, okay, I like both of these about Pyramid.

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:38.040
And I didn't consider Django as much because it's a micro frameworks bent that I have, I guess.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.120
And that's a personal thing, right?

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:39.400
Yeah.

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.240
No, for sure.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:40.480
Yeah.

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:44.860
And I think it also, yeah, I guess like depends on the nature of the site and your workflow.

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:48.540
I think you do a lot of like terminal driven stuff, right?

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:52.680
When you just showed me your deploy process or when you, like, what does it look like for you?

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.640
I'm really interested in the workflows, right?

00:47:54.640 --> 00:48:01.140
Because for a new podcast episode to go out, like what's going to happen once we're done recording this and you want to publish it on the website?

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:02.040
Oh, that's a good question.

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:07.500
So when we're done recording this right now, recording it, I'm going to convert it to multi-track WAV files.

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:11.860
I'm going to hit it with some audio filters, some quick editing, quick leveling.

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:20.280
So even if our mic settings are different or our distance we're holding our mics are different or like normally it's recorded at different locations, it all sounds like we're in the same room mostly.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.500
I'm going to send that off to Marco.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:23.220
Shout out to you.

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:24.200
I'm sure you're editing it now.

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.980
And Marco is an awesome guy that's been supporting me for a long time.

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.620
And he edits it into its final form.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:30.540
I take that back.

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:34.620
I actually have a bunch of other little bits, like the ad bits and the intro bits and the music.

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:40.200
And I do all that in GarageBand because GarageBand is good for multi-track stuff.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:44.040
I don't actually do the audio editing there, but I do like the composition of the tracks there.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.820
Put that into an MP3.

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.460
I upload that to S3.

00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:50.100
Like manually with the...

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.640
I'll use Transmit, but yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:53.500
So I upload that.

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:56.840
And then it goes into the Python world.

00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.260
So then I log into a backend on Talk Python.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.020
And I say, here's a new episode.

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.440
I type in the details and I say, here's the URL on S3.

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.520
And you could just serve it off S3.

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:11.560
But the amount of bandwidth that's going through there, like let me just do a quick test here.

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.640
So we have...

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:15.280
I want to have the right numbers and I want to make enough stuff here.

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:20.720
So if I served it off S3, it would be like $600 or $700 a month, which is not the end of the world,

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.200
but it's not ideal, I guess, right?

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:24.220
Especially when I was getting started.

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:31.320
And so I actually have another server, another virtual server that has tons of available paid bandwidth, right?

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:35.620
And with that, I just put it on there and just serve it out of IntuneX as a static file.

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:40.340
So when I add the S3 URL, it'll like grab it.

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.620
It's sort of a cache server.

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:43.500
Like it'll ask from the place it actually comes from.

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.060
And if it's not there, it'll get it from S3.

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:47.320
But if it is there, it'll serve it off disk.

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:54.480
And the reason is like that I'm even doing that is if for some reason I need to stop doing that or it goes down,

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:58.660
then I can just flip a switch and it'll fill back to S3.

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:03.480
So S3 is always there as like a reliable backend for the media content.

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:08.840
And as far as like updating the content on the website goes, like you...

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:10.940
There's like a little editor backend I built.

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:11.200
Okay.

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:11.620
Yeah.

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:11.920
Yeah.

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.760
Like a little web form or something where you could...

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:13.960
Yeah, exactly.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:18.000
Like, you know, four or five pages that'll edit episodes, edit guests, things like that.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:18.160
Yeah.

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:18.720
It's interesting.

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:24.360
Like I was just thinking like maybe a big part of the, you know, different approaches there is for your workflow

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.500
because it's so, it's heavily media based, right?

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:29.040
Like the deliverable is an MP3 file.

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:29.280
Yeah.

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.260
And so...

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.540
There's a lot of steps I can't avoid no matter what, right?

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:32.780
Yeah.

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:33.020
Yeah.

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:37.980
And it's like a different, you know, when I compare this, for example, to RealPython,

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:42.560
RealPython is more like a multi-user online magazine, really, right?

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:42.700
Yeah.

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:43.940
Like from the backend perspective.

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:48.000
And Django is great for that because it was built for that purpose, you know, at a news organization.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.520
And so, at a newspaper journal.

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:57.140
And so, it was like a perfect natural fit for that because it gives you all this like amazing admin interface and all that stuff.

00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:03.500
But when you're doing a podcast, like a lot of the technical aspects, you got to build a custom workflow for that anyway.

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:08.460
Like because a lot of it is like audio processing distribution and the content delivery.

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:12.920
Whereas with more like a magazine-based site, it's more you're doing a website.

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:15.980
You need multiple people interacting with the site side of things, right?

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:16.160
Yeah.

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:16.240
Yeah.

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:20.960
Where my main work is on the media locally and it just happens to be delivered there.

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:21.180
Yeah.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:21.760
Interesting.

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.480
Here's the thing.

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.900
It's like, could I change things to do something better?

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:26.120
Maybe, maybe not.

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:26.800
But it's like...

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:27.300
It's all relative.

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.680
And it's just, it's working so well for me.

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.440
Like it's totally spot on.

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:32.240
So, and I'm happy.

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.280
So, you know, it's all good.

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:33.520
Yeah.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:33.980
Yeah.

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:34.760
No, for sure.

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:38.420
I think, yeah, that's like the biggest thing to keep in mind there that it's all...

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:41.080
As long as it works, there's not necessarily like...

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:45.280
There's not a huge benefit to improving things much beyond that point.

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.240
I mean, I want to rewrite things all the time.

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.080
But realistically, you want extra...

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:50.440
It's a diminishing returns thing.

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:50.820
Right.

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:51.240
Absolutely.

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.960
For example, like you launched your mobile apps now.

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:54.240
Right.

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.140
That is a huge thing.

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:59.080
Instead, you could have spent the last year like rewriting all of your existing infrastructure.

00:51:59.080 --> 00:51:59.360
Right.

00:51:59.360 --> 00:51:59.800
Exactly.

00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:01.380
So, it's in the hottest new framework.

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:03.200
It could be all Vue.js or whatever.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:03.660
Right.

00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:04.780
Like on Docker.

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:05.380
But whatever.

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:07.660
I got my mobile app and that adds true value.

00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:08.120
Right.

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:12.280
When you're a small group of people working on something, you got to focus where it counts.

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:14.840
So, maybe that's worth talking about a little bit.

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.720
You know, people ask, you know, did I use Python for my mobile apps?

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:24.180
So, people who don't know, released two apps where you can take the courses in a much better

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:27.220
way on iOS or Android phones or tablets, whatever.

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:27.760
Right.

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:28.540
There's a lot of...

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:32.540
Especially on iOS, there's a lot of limitations to trying to do that through even a nice web

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:32.780
app.

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:35.020
It's just not the same.

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:39.200
So, having something truly native there was super important to me.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.600
And I've wanted to do it for a long time.

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:44.660
And I knew it was going to set me back in terms of productivity and getting stuff done.

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:46.580
But I finally broke down and did it.

00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:49.280
So, I guess the first question is what's it built in, huh?

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:49.720
Yeah.

00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:50.460
Is it Python?

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.020
Man, I wish it was Python.

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:53.800
I tried to make it Python.

00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:56.000
I even looked at Ionic for a while.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:56.900
Ionic's pretty cool.

00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:01.000
But I wanted something native for iOS, something native for Android.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.700
I didn't want to do Kotlin and Swift.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:06.860
I have a decent amount of experience with C#.

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:07.160
Right.

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.160
And the JavaScript.

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:15.060
So, the two choices were do something with Cordova phone gap type of thing, maybe on Ionic and some front-end framework there.

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.560
Or do something native with C# and Xamarin.

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:23.300
So, Xamarin takes your code and compiles it down to native instructions on iOS and on Android.

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.400
And it's like a true native app.

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.620
So, that's what I ended up doing.

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:35.060
And as far as the native apps go, like the mobile apps in this case, I think you've done some experimentation in the past, too, with like Electron and stuff like that.

00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:35.100
Yeah.

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:36.100
That's more for the desktop side.

00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:36.320
Yeah.

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:39.400
I had originally like prototyped it out with Electron.js.

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:44.040
And I was going to like move that to Ionic because they have the widgets that look native on the devices.

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:47.920
And they're just like, it was a constant whack-a-mole.

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:48.860
Like, I fixed this.

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:49.480
Boom, that broke.

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:50.100
I fixed this.

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:50.780
Boom, that broke.

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:51.960
And I'm just like, all right, this sucks.

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:52.600
I don't want to do this.

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:54.740
Like, let me try something else, you know.

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:54.980
Yeah.

00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:57.460
You know, Xamarin is 100% free, right?

00:53:57.460 --> 00:53:58.080
So, that's cool.

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.300
Plus, you were a C# developer in another life.

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:00.520
Yeah, exactly.

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:04.360
So, I had enough experience that that was not a horrible choice to me.

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:05.640
Like, would I prefer to write in Python?

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:06.200
Yes.

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.900
But can I go write?

00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:14.020
In fact, what I did was I wrote the prototype in C# and WPF on Windows because I knew how to do that.

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.180
I didn't know how to do it on iOS or Android.

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:22.860
And then I hired a developer to help write that for the mobile stuff and just worked with them on that.

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:24.480
And that was a really good experience.

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:27.580
What was it like publishing these mobile apps?

00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:32.560
Because, I mean, we're, in a way, I feel like we're really jaded creating content for the web or programming stuff for the web.

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.460
I guess what I could say is I didn't realize how good we had it.

00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:38.020
I'm serious.

00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:40.000
I mean, holy moly.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.820
Like, the stuff would break all the time.

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:46.860
I would get builds from the guy I was working with and it would be like, oh, this doesn't work anymore.

00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:49.660
Oh, did you do a build clean rebuild all on it?

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:50.700
No, I forgot.

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.060
Oh, now it works.

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:54.620
You know, you're like, what the heck is going on with this stuff?

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:57.280
You know, then you hit the app store and the gatekeepers.

00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:58.640
And, oh, my God.

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.580
It's so super scary.

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:06.400
There was one person I was working with at Google and one person, presumably, I'm working with at Apple.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:10.400
And if both places rejected the app over and over.

00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:16.520
And it was like, well, if I can't make this person happy, the last four months of work go down the train.

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.760
And my hope of having a mobile app are gone.

00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:22.960
And there's this person who is massively incompetent.

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:28.180
Like, let me just give you, I'm not going to go too long, but I just want to say I have a lot of sympathy for mobile developers now.

00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:38.320
So, I submit the app on Android and the title is Talk Python Training Player, Talk Python Training Courses, something like that.

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:38.520
Yeah.

00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:39.220
That's the title.

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:43.920
The subtitle is Take Talk Python Courses on, you know, on your device.

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:49.400
But in the description, it said Talk Python Training for Android is the best way to take our courses.

00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.060
You can learn Python.

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:53.060
You can learn to be a web developer and so on.

00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:53.820
Boom, rejected.

00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:55.000
Why was it rejected?

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.040
It was rejected because there is an app called Learn Python and I'm trying to impersonate it.

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.760
Like, where do you get that?

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:03.000
And eventually I see where it says you can learn Python here.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.460
I'm like, oh, they must think.

00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:06.800
But it's like not the title, not the subtitles.

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.040
No graphics are about it.

00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.440
Like, but way down there's the word you can learn Python.

00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:11.440
It's no more verbs, man.

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.240
It's all trademarks.

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:18.820
So, I had to have an argument for four days because there's like a 12-hour turnaround period of it can say you can learn Python.

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:22.380
And that doesn't mean it is associated with an app whose title is Learn Python.

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:26.260
Eventually, the thing that broke that loose was, let's try a different word.

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:28.480
Let's say it was physics or music.

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:31.860
You want to, you can learn music with our app.

00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:34.680
Does that mean we are the app called Learn Music?

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:35.100
No.

00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:38.960
But like, I had to have this conversation for days with this person.

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:43.620
And if they just disagreed with me, they decided then I'm out of the app store.

00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:43.960
Yeah.

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:50.060
You've made that investment to build the apps and somebody has worked on it for weeks and, you know, you have to coordinate everything.

00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:52.220
Like, I pay for it, you know, like pay for the development.

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:52.440
Yeah.

00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.000
And you can't find out until you're done.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:54.300
Yeah.

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:54.540
Right?

00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.660
You can't pre-submit it and see if they like it.

00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:56.840
Right?

00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:57.000
Yeah.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:57.180
You can't.

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:58.020
That's what we're thinking.

00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:58.240
Yeah.

00:56:58.240 --> 00:56:58.420
Yeah.

00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:58.740
That's cool.

00:56:58.740 --> 00:56:59.180
Keep going.

00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.000
You do it all and you try to launch it and they say no.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.280
And it could be reasonable or it could be unreasonable.

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:04.760
Yeah.

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:05.080
Unreasonable.

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:07.760
But anyway, I'm super happy they're out.

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:10.880
I guess to round out that conversation, there's a bunch of APIs it works with.

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:13.360
And of course, those APIs are all in Python on the server.

00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:24.180
But the thing you have on your phone is a Xamarin app, which is, I think, is a pretty cool thing that we have like 95% code reuse, visual designers, everything, and debuggers for it.

00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:27.540
95% code reuse across the various platforms and so on.

00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:30.800
I think that's going to help a lot in just keeping things manageable.

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:31.080
Right?

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:34.900
Because again, it's coming back to like, you're not 100 people working on infrastructure.

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:36.160
I can't have a Kotlin team.

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:36.680
Right?

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:37.820
Like, I don't know what this stuff like.

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:38.000
Yeah.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.980
And you've got to be able, in the worst case scenario, you've got to be able to go in and jump in and maybe do a bug fix or something.

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:43.020
Yeah.

00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:43.220
Yeah.

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:44.240
Something quick or whatever.

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:44.520
Right?

00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:46.460
Like, if it were massive, I'd hire somebody.

00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:50.580
But other than that, like, yeah, you want to be able to at least take it over if you have to somewhat.

00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:51.180
Yeah.

00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:52.260
So, that worked pretty well.

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:53.020
It's a really cool app.

00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:55.500
I mean, you showed me later and I installed it on my phone.

00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:59.480
And it's just really smooth and fast.

00:57:59.480 --> 00:57:59.820
Thanks.

00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:01.920
I think for a first release, like, it's really, really cool.

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:02.160
Yeah.

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:02.480
Yeah.

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:04.700
I'm really happy how it came out.

00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:05.440
I'm glad we did it.

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:08.180
But boy, it was a shaky process to get there.

00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:08.620
Yeah.

00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:08.620
Yeah.

00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.920
Not technically, but, like, approval and stuff.

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:11.120
Yeah.

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:14.680
I guess, you know, one more thing that I'd like to, like, sort of exchange.

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:17.000
Well, I'm doing what you're doing just so people can know.

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:20.220
Is, like, so, we have the stuff hosted.

00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:21.320
Like, you talked about Heroku.

00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:22.780
I got my servers and so on.

00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.520
But I also use AWS for a bunch of stuff.

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:27.000
Even though I'm not on EC2.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.460
I'm not a huge fan of EC2.

00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:31.740
I think it's really expensive and really complicated.

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:36.080
I think it's built for, like, running Netflix and other massively awesome things.

00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:41.260
But if I just want a server, you know, it's like, well, my security groups aren't, like,

00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:44.720
I just want a little firewall and I just want to, anyway, let's not make that a rant.

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:48.720
But even though I'm not using AWS, I'm still using Elastic Transcoder.

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.320
I'm using Simple Email Service.

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:53.620
I'm using S3, Stripe.

00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:55.680
I've got Stripe, MailChimp.

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:59.780
There's a bunch of other services that get involved here.

00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:00.960
Like, how about you?

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:01.820
Like, what else are you using?

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:08.300
It's so fun, or not fun, but it's hard to think about this and, like, remember all the

00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:08.520
services.

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:08.940
I know.

00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:09.880
I'm sure I'm missing some.

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:14.300
But, like, for me, like, in terms of software that I use, Redis plays a big role.

00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:19.260
Like, it's basically our caching system in between the database and, or not, you know, not in

00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:22.560
between in any sort of, like, physical direct sense, but, like, the Django app will talk to

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:25.600
Redis and put some stuff there as a cache, like, the sessions live there.

00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:31.340
I was wondering, like, are you using anything like Memcached or Redis or any apps?

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:37.260
I've considered using Redis for some of the search, like, build up a search index and

00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:37.800
put it there.

00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:40.420
But in the end, I'm just using MongoDB.

00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:40.880
Yeah.

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:45.300
I mean, I'm using Postgres for a lot of things, like the full-text search.

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:48.180
I was like, let's just see how far we can get with Postgres full-text search.

00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:52.400
And it's actually amazing how much modern databases can just do for you.

00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:53.000
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.080
Where you, yeah, you don't have to invent this stuff from scratch or build your own index.

00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:57.440
Yeah.

00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:57.820
Yeah.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.040
As far as infrastructure goes, yeah, I've got, actually, PythonistaCafe.com is hosted

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.000
on a DigitalOcean box.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:04.300
Okay.

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.200
That's been really helpful.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:05.760
Yeah, awesome.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:09.340
And, yeah, I've been super happy with their service and, you know, just rock-solid hosting,

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:09.900
I felt like.

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:12.200
Let me throw one thing out there for people listening, by the way.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.940
If you're thinking about hosting and you want to be on Amazon, check out Amazon LightSail.

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:17.080
Do you know about LightSail?

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.160
It's, like, really small.

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:21.680
So, it has the same pricing as DigitalOcean and Linode.

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.700
In bandwidth.

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:28.200
You get a free terabyte with a $5 server, which is $100 worth of bandwidth on S3 equivalent.

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:28.540
Nice.

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:32.360
And so, if you just want to be on Amazon, but you don't want all that stuff, like, and,

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.380
you know, LightSail as well.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.140
Anyway, keep going.

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:34.380
Yeah.

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:34.540
Yeah.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:35.080
Yeah.

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:40.000
Also use S3 and then CloudFlare as the CDN in front of everything.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.100
You do a lot with CloudFlare, right?

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:41.260
Yeah.

01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:42.660
It's been incredibly useful.

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:47.740
They have this great image transcoding service that is totally transparent to you, where they

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:50.600
will recompress your images and do, like, a browser detection.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:55.220
So, if you're on Chrome or, like, modern Firefox, they will transcode your images to WebP

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:56.300
and then serve them out.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:00.500
And that could, you know, reduce your image sizes to, like, basically half them.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:04.800
And I don't have to go and, on the back end, write the logic for, like, oh, does this

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:09.260
specific version of Chrome support this format or Safari or whatever?

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:10.280
No, it can't be WebP.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.020
It's got to be whatever.

01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:14.500
But they make that decision for you and they can update those rules for everybody.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.400
So, that's been incredibly helpful.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.500
I guess we're basically out of time, Dan.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:22.580
And there's, like, still so much more stuff we could talk about.

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:24.200
Email, I think, would be super interesting.

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:27.500
But maybe we'll do another one of these if there's interest.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:28.480
Yeah, I guess we could come back.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:31.740
I guess one other thing that people ask a lot that I just want to throw out there, it's,

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:34.280
like, why MongoDB and NoSQL versus relational?

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.280
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:35.520
Yeah.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:40.140
And to me, like, it's just the modeling stuff in the NoSQL database is really easy.

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:44.540
But the one thing I really love is, like, I've not done a database migration in two years.

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:45.020
Right?

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:46.360
But the data models have changed a lot.

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:46.580
Right?

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:51.960
Because the document databases or schema can just adapt most of the time to the new classes,

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.980
especially if it's additive and not subtractive.

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:55.180
You've never been burned by that?

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:58.560
Like, I kind of like having a schema I can trust.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:01:58.940
Yes.

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:03.940
So here's the reason I don't think I've been burned by it is I have, to me, I know the schema

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:06.620
safety structure is in the app code.

01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:10.600
So I have a special tier whose job it is to just talk to the database.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.980
And it always enforces the schema.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.020
And, like, I never, ever talk to it anyway other than through that part of code.

01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:16.300
Okay.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.220
And so...

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:18.960
The schema is in the business code.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.940
There is still a schema because otherwise the code won't run.

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:22.220
Yeah.

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:25.760
But if you just ad hoc it or if you have five apps to talk to it and they don't share

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.060
that bit, then you very well could get burned.

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:30.540
So I'm just super careful because I've done it before.

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:35.140
And I think, like, if you're the sole developer working on it, I think that's a great model

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:35.580
too, right?

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:38.940
Where, yeah, you can take these shortcuts and they're basically fine.

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:42.160
But as soon as you have, like, I don't know, if you have a team of, like, 50 people working

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:45.840
on an application, then that stuff just starts breaking, like, every single day, right?

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:50.140
Where it's like, oh, who put a bunch of strings into this integer field?

01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:50.640
Exactly.

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:56.060
Yeah, but for example, I use Mongo Engine, which is like SQLAlchemy or Django ORM, and

01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:59.400
it will not let you put strings where integers go, for example, right?

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.640
So the safety is in the data access layer, but it's not that it's not there.

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:04.080
You know what I mean?

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:04.440
Right, right.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.280
It's just shifted, like, it lives in the application versus the database.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:11.620
It's kind of like the monolith versus microservice conversation as well, right?

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:11.960
Yeah.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:17.440
Is there anything that we both really wanted to talk about, but we haven't yet?

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.520
I feel like we covered a lot of stuff.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:23.000
We haven't really talked about Python bytes, I think, the infrastructure for that.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.760
Well, Python bytes is pretty much like a fork of Talk Python.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:27.200
Nice.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:28.180
So it's real, real similar.

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:28.680
Yeah.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:32.900
I mean, it's got its own instance of an app and database and stuff, but it's basically the

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:33.080
same.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.020
We got the training stuff.

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.440
I think that's pretty much, I guess.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:39.780
If you were to do this all over again, like right now, and you had a month to rebuild it,

01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:43.500
like infinite time to rebuild it, how would you do anything different?

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.880
I don't know that I would do too much different.

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:48.040
Like, I'm really happy where things are.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.980
Like, it doesn't go down.

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:50.920
It's easy to maintain.

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:51.840
It's cost effective.

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.940
The way I got here was like a circuitous path of like, oh, I'm going to try this platform

01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:57.620
as a service thing.

01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:59.000
Oh, it's kind of not really reliable.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.440
Oh, I'm going to use SQLite so I don't have to deal with this other stuff.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.840
But like, oh, now things are outgrowing that.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:10.840
And just, I would have gone more towards either where I am or maybe towards Heroku or something

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:15.440
like that, where you are, if I felt like a platform as a service would have made me happier.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.640
I don't think I would change too much, but I would have gotten to where I was a lot better.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.040
But like, that's more quickly, like that's the curse of knowledge, right?

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.580
Like you kind of, how about you?

01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:26.140
Yeah, I feel the same.

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:32.420
I mean, I'm pretty happy with how like all of the hosting aspects and the technical side

01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:33.040
of that.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.560
I think, I mean, it's much more about creating.

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.280
I have to continuously remind me of that, right?

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:43.440
where like the goal of this business is to provide really, really good training material

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:48.180
to people and to enable people to learn better and become better Python programmers.

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:48.600
Right.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.120
Neither of us are selling tech.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:54.580
We're selling content and education and experiences.

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:57.480
And this is just the facilitation layer.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:57.860
Yeah.

01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:00.700
And so from that perspective, I'm super happy with the tech.

01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:04.340
And I think, you know, also considering that, what we just said, it's really important that

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:09.240
it's fun to work with the tech and that we get to work with all these interesting tools

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:13.340
and learn more about them so we can go out and teach others about them and share that.

01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:15.820
So from that perspective, yeah, I'm super happy.

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:18.980
I mean, I would want to rewrite it in PHP or anything like that.

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:20.760
No, definitely not.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.220
The themes, they're just not worth it.

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:23.060
Don't do it.

01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:24.100
All right.

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:26.980
Well, Dan, thanks for doing this.

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:32.240
Don't like sort of interview me and sort of 50-50 hosting of the show today.

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.160
I really appreciate it.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:33.700
It's been a ton of fun.

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:33.820
Yeah.

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.320
This is so cool to do this in person, like sitting next to each other.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:40.240
Like initially it was like, oh, you know, when we're talking to each other, there's no delay.

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.920
Like usually there's like a 200 millisecond or I don't know how long delay is like over Skype.

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:45.960
We talk over each other all the time because of the latency and stuff.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.500
Yeah, it's great.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.140
The bandwidth is awesome right here.

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:48.380
Yeah.

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:50.500
It's 3D too.

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:51.220
It's all cool.

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:53.080
Thank you, Dan, for doing this.

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:56.040
And I can certainly recommend folks come out to PyCon next year.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:58.400
Hopefully you could see some of this live as well.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:58.900
Oh, yeah.

01:05:58.900 --> 01:05:59.680
No, it was great.

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.360
It was, yeah, just a ton of fun.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.240
We're going to be, PyCon is going to be in Pittsburgh.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:05.160
So that's, I've never been to Pittsburgh.

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:05.540
Me either.

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:06.240
I'm looking forward to it.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:06.520
I'm looking forward to that.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.480
All right.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:08.000
Well, cheers.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:08.560
Thanks for being here.

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.060
All right.

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:10.920
Thanks so much for inviting me again.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:11.500
Bye.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.740

Thanks so much for listening.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.720
I really appreciate it.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.460
Now get out there and write some Python code.

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:37.460
Thank you.

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:44.460
Thank you.

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:51.460
Thank you.
