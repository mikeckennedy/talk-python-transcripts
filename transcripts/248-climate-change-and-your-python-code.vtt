00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.120
The most critical issue of our time is climate change.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.060
Yet, when you think about our carbon impact in the software industry, what comes to mind?

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.100
Business travel?

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.960
Commuting to the office so you don't miss filing that TPS report?

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.440
Yeah, those are bad.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.360
But data centers, servers, and our apps consume a substantial portion of the total energy used by modern humans.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.940
In this episode, you'll meet Chris Adams.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.620
He's been advocating for a greener software environment and has concrete advice to make your Python programs more climate-friendly.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:38.540
The good news is, generally speaking, what we need to do to make our code easier on the planet is the same things we do to make our code faster.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:46.180
Dive into software and climate on this episode, number 248, recorded December 11th, 2019.

Chris, welcome to Talk Python To Me.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.280
Thank you very much for having me, Michael.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.480
I'm really excited to have you on the show.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.080
This is a topic that I've not covered a ton.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:40.340
We have had a previous show on studying climate science in Python, but we haven't really dove into how that affects us individually

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:52.500
and how the ways that we write software or think about how we host our code or even how fast our website responds directly can correlate to contributing to or alleviating some of the pressure on emissions.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.120
So those types of things are going to be so fun to talk about with you.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.360
Cool.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.400
I'm looking forward to it.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.480
The thing I can tell you is that if it's new to you, you're in good company.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.720
There's lots and lots of people.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.220
And I say this with love who figured out that, yes, the Internet is often someone else's computer,

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.620
but that means someone else's computer is running electricity.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.380
And in many cases, that comes from us burning fossil fuels or things.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.160
You're definitely not the only person to be thinking about this.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:27.240
And more and more of us are waking up to this fact and realizing that we are in quite a pivotal position to change how we work and end up working in a more kind of planet-friendly way, I feel.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.020
There's so many things that are low-hanging fruit that we can do, right?

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.940
I mean, obviously, this is a big problem that needs big solutions.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.800
But look, if stuff's easy, let's do it.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.880
So we're going to talk about that.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.760
Now, before we get into that whole side of things, let's just start with your story.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.960
How did you get into programming in Python?

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.260
I actually got into programming not through university or anything like that.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.960
I actually studied to become a doctor.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.220
And partly because when I was growing up, my parents were really keen on me becoming a doctor.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.460
So, yeah, I'll be a good kid.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.700
I'll try and become a doctor.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.340
Then I kind of discovered photography.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.800
And I got really, really into that in high school.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.200
And I got so excited about that that my plans for kind of going to, say, kind of Oxbridge or something basically fell by the wayside.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.580
And I got really, really into studying things like media and film.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:17.320
And I went from there to basically study, yeah, photography, filmmaking, video production, stuff like that, playing with these things.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.260
And I'm showing my age when I say this now.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.400
But I was this is around the turn of the century.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.520
We were just starting to kind of start playing with things like Final Cut Pro and digital video.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.220
Because when I was studying this, we were literally, you know, like cut and paste.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.760
Yes.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.040
I ran it with cut.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.780
We were, when we were making films, we were using like hand winding films, a kind of Bolex camera.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.660
We literally had to kind of cut film and paste it to make films.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.600
That is a really, really hard way to edit video together, right?

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.140
I mean, now it's like splice, splice, splice, digital this, transforms that.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.840
It's crazy.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.020
But that's how it was, right?

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.320
Like the world has changed so much in 20, 30 years and it's easy to forget.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.660
Exactly.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.460
So we did this.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:03.500
And at the time there was this thing which was called New Media, which was other ways of kind of expressing yourself or exploring things.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.280
And through that, there was this kind of interest in this thing called digital.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:13.120
So I kind of started playing around with things like Dreamweaver or ActionScript or stuff like this.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.780
And I thought, wow, this is kind of cool.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:23.020
Like because there was a load of really interesting art in this field right now because people were trying to explore the medium and what any of that's actually meant.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.060
What kind of kind of impact it would have socially for us, really.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.100
And on the course I was studying, you are basically given quite a lot of freedom, almost too much freedom.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:40.420
So when we end up graduating, a lot of us had kind of black and white films about ourselves, which was I didn't find that interesting myself.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:54.980
But we also had a chance to just like mess around with computers to either explore an idea or I guess like try and build some kind of installation or something, which would help you interrogate an idea that you might have come across in the kind of art culture part.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.100
And we had a kind of media education part of the course I did.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.140
And a large part was about things like, say, media ownership and things like the California ideology.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:12.420
And there were loads of really wild ideas that came across, which in the turn of the century seemed like bonkers concepts.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.380
There was this idea called surveillance, like the way we might kind of relate to computers.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:24.720
Like you had kind of cultural commentators and artists talking about imagine what it's going to be like when everyone has computers and everyone can film everything.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.020
Right.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.580
Yeah.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.080
And now here we are with our cell phones, right?

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.940
Like it's here.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.280
Yeah.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.860
Like the thing.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.520
So I got into this idea.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:38.180
And one of the things I started working, I really got interested in was this idea by this theorist called Jamekassio.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.780
I think I pronounced his name properly.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.780
He spoke about this idea of the participatory panopticon.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:50.200
Like when we all have cameras, there will be no real concept of privacy and will forever be kind of recording things and sharing things.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.020
And there was this kind of idea that rather than having kind of big brother, there was millions of little brothers.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.940
And that has all kinds of ramifications on how like how we relate to each other.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.060
So I built I ended up working with a friend of mine because I couldn't really code at this point.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.200
I was just like some I don't know, some art student, really.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.520
And I lived in a part of town which was kind of rough because I didn't know how hard it would be.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:29.220
I thought, well, maybe we can like get a Linux box, find a way to run it in the car, run it off a like 15 pound webcam, connect to some GPS and some Wi-Fi, run this all off the cigarette lighter of the car and build something like a kind of panopticon thing for ourselves to see how that might change how we think about it.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:42.400
Yeah. And because we had this whole notion of because on the course, there was all this conversation about, say, the kind of Californian ideology and Silicon Valley in this way that in many cases, lots of companies present themselves as changing the world.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.600
We figured, well, maybe we can kind of dress up in some of that language to explore this as an idea.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:54.180
So rather than make a film, I figured, let's try to create some kind of intervention using open source software and a kind of cultural, I guess, thing.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:03.840
So I basically built this thing with a friend of mine or more specifically, my friend did all the coding whilst I was learning how to kind of code and kind of do some of this and work out what a ring buffer was and everything.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:11.920
And we built a thing which basically was a giant red button on a dashboard hooked up to a webcam that ran a ring buff in front of you.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:23.040
And what would happen is when you're driving around, if someone cuts you up, rather than screaming at them, because who knows, they might be carrying a knife or a gun or something, you'd pull over and you just hit this button like,

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:35.920
Oh, God damn it. Why can't they drive properly? And that would catch where and how that person almost hit you with the idea being that when you drive home, when you're on the Wi-Fi, you'd upload this video to like YouTube or somewhere.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.460
And the great thing about this is that, well, cars have really handy foreign keys called number plates.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.580
And if you can then expose a feed of this, you could create some kind of business model around this.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:52.400
So we kind of, as a kind of, I don't know, artsy statement, accidentally ended up building dashcams.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:52.940
All right.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.480
Right. Yeah, exactly.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.220
Yeah. So we figured, wouldn't it be weird if people had something like this?

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.940
Wouldn't that be like, end up with all these strange implications?

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:13.820
Because we kind of designed a business model as an art project around, well, if you provide this information, then maybe the thing that you might get, you might get an incentive to basically film everyone else doing this if you got cheaper insurance premiums.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:28.200
And because like insurance companies don't need to disclose how they price you, you could have this idea where you could present the idea that you're pricing people off the roads for bad driving, but instead create this kind of horrifying dystopian hellscape where everyone's continually filming each other.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.120
And that seemed more interesting than making a film.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.700
That's a pretty interesting social experiment.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.160
Yeah.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:34.820
Where'd it go?

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.000
Yeah.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.440
So, well, we, so there's the other thing.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:43.020
There is an idea called, if you look at work with IP, like intellectual property, there's a phrase called prior arts.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.120
And we thought, oh my God, this is, this is, this is horrifying what we're building.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.900
Well, now we've explored this, the implications are terrifying.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:55.320
So we figured, well, one thing we can do is let's take this prior art idea quite literally and like put it in a gallery.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.060
So it's literally prior art.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:02.600
And if you do it that way, then you cannot patent it because it's kind of toxic and no one can make any money off it.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.640
And like, of course we were naive students.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.240
All right.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:10.120
So like, I'm pretty sure large companies have found ways to make money out of data now.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.280
But this was an idea like, yeah, as if anyone would really do that.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:13.560
Right.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.940
And that was kind of my first exposure into coding.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.480
And that was, that was actually Ruby initially with little bits of C and stuff.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.760
But I found the two of them quite difficult.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.300
And especially back then.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:32.320
And then when I graduated, I was looking for something similarly interesting and out there.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.560
And I couldn't find much, but the person who I built that with, I mean, he only built this because he was doing a cognitive science course.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.180
And he thought some of the ideas, some of my ideas were kind of funny.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.920
We ended up setting up a company where we figured we're only going to work on open source, nice things.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:54.680
And we ended up working in a co-working space and find ourselves working on bits of Django or doing some kind of Internet of Things related stuff.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.640
And I think I've just shared a link to some of the earliest code I've ever contributed to.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:05.500
And like my first Python as a person who could barely write HTML was diving straight into Twisted.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:10.440
And oh, I'm not sure that was the first code I should have written, right?

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.520
Yeah, that's definitely mind bending that async stuff.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:21.860
Well, look, if you can start out by building, like recreating dash cams in the software and hardware side,

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.100
and then you can go contribute or work on code that's for Twisted, I think you'll be all right.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.340
Well, that was actually a kind of interesting project.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.960
That project, the Twisted stuff, there's a story around that, actually.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.480
So what we were doing, we're in this co-working space.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:41.120
And we were thinking, well, wouldn't it be cool if you could help people understand that there is an environmental impact to how we use buildings?

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:51.600
And maybe if you can do something what we might call now, like flexible pricing around co-working space to kind of incentivize people to use it when it's not so much.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.440
So think of it like, I don't know, load balancing or demand shifting, but with people rather than like servers.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:06.000
So we ended up working on some things to basically work out the carbon footprint per person per hour of space by inferring presence on Wi-Fi,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.600
but looking at it by tracking the MAC addresses in a co-working space.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:14.940
Because we could pretty much figure it out that if there is maybe, if every single person has a phone and a laptop,

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.140
if you can count the laptops and the phones and you can more or less associate them with each other,

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.640
then you get a rough idea of occupancy and usage of spaces here.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.200
And if you know how much energy you're using, you can work that out as well.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.460
Right. And mostly that's probably heating, cooling, that kind of stuff, not people plugging in their laptops.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:36.840
So if there's one person versus 10 people, it costs almost 10 times as much for that one person in terms of energy.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.520
Absolutely. Right.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.200
So this was one thing you could do.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.060
So if you can encourage people to kind of scrunch together to use that space more efficiently,

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.220
then you've got a much more efficient use of that space per person.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:53.320
And if you think in terms of not buildings, but providing working space, again, which is kind of what you see now,

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:58.260
there are so many kind of lucrative businesses that I've failed to kind of take forward.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.940
You were really early at a lot of these things, right?

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.360
Yeah, we ended up doing a lot of stuff like that.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.240
And that was my exposure to messing around with like Python and Twisted because we said,

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.740
oh, yeah, we could do that because we figured you're just reading RFID cards, right?

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:17.940
And then my friend Fred Fix, who now lives in Berlin and as a CTO of some of the same companies we were working on part time with that,

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:24.520
we basically had to find a way to make these things speak to some parts of a building to trigger some actuators for sliding doors to work.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.800
And in order to do that, we figured, well, we use Twisted and we need a server to make a door work.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.560
So the link I've shared is door D because it's like a demon for a door.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.240
Oh, nice.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.300
Yeah.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:42.540
And we had like all these ideas to look to this because the space we're in, they had like an open LDAP installation for the members.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:47.640
So we, at one point, we kind of hooked this up so that when you walked in or tapped to RFID card,

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.780
because you could make that speak to the speakers, you could have like your theme song walk in, right?

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.880
Or you could have like loads of silly ideas like that.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.680
Because if you could, yeah, I mean, it's, if you can think of an entire building as like a gigantic Linux box,

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.540
then there's kind of fun things you can do.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.620
Yeah, that's really clever.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:02.260
I like it.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:02.480
Yeah.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:02.800
Yeah.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.080
We also realized there's loads of silly things you can do as well.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.800
I mean, I learned firsthand that, so we, yeah, in 2000, I think seven,

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:15.280
I've realized that if you put a door on the internet and you expose an IP address for anyone to use, right?

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:22.840
Then we ended up with scenarios where you had like loads of hacking attempts from China trying to kind of like pwn the door because they just saw it as an IP address.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:27.440
And we ended up having quite a few phone calls like, Chris, yeah, the door's going a bit weird again.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.300
Can you fix that, please?

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:28.800
Yeah.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.140
The door's got a DDoS attack on it.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:32.760
What are we going to do?

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:33.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.580
Like, I'm sure there's a joke about doors and DD doors or something there, right?

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.840
But yeah, the DDoS door.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.520
But anyway, there was something like, but we also, when we were working with this,

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.940
I realized that there's a reason hardware is called hardware.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.200
And I decided to make, okay, let's work with software a bit more.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.760
And then I started working with Django a bit on a couple of other projects.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.300
And I found Django really, really nice as a framework to work with because it was really well documented.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.280
And I found the community quite friendly.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:03.740
And yeah, that's probably how I got into programming was kind of artsy student trying to implement things,

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.280
realizing that I didn't know what I was doing.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.160
And then realized I had to actually run some of this myself and had to learn how to use servers and stuff.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.100
So I have a bit of a patchy background.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.760
And only in like 2016 did I really start reading about data structures.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.580
And like, oh, God, this would have been so much easier if I didn't know this 10 years ago.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.040
Exactly.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.980
This would have totally, we created this.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.080
Why did I create this?

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:25.780
It just existed.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:26.940
Yeah.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:32.080
Man, what a cool series of sort of getting into it, getting into programming experiences.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:32.800
Those are great.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.600
So what are you doing now?

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.840
At the moment, I am splitting my time working with one group called the Green Web Foundation,

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:44.420
where I am currently helping them in kind of rebuild chunks of their stuff in Django and

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.120
splitting my time working with a group called climateaction.tech.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.860
And generally working as a kind of consultant, product manager consultant, I've still got where

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:56.120
groups will basically work with me and hire me to help them think through their process.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:01.700
But I've still got a few old Django clients who I've been looking after and still work

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.760
with them every now and again.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.800
So I do a kind of bit of a mixed grab bag of all this stuff.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.940
But increasingly, I find myself doing a lot more work with tech and climate, specifically

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.820
speaking to techies who have said, hey, I want to do something more responsible with my

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:19.260
skills, or we're building a project and we figured out that we're using electricity to

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:19.900
run computers.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.080
And maybe we should think about that part there.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.100
Or I'm planning to set up some kind of practice around how we build digital projects.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:32.140
And we want to be a bit more responsible about the unintended consequences that we might have

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.000
when working on that.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.360
So I do a bunch of these things.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:39.400
And I've started writing about this stuff in a newsletter called Greening Digital, because,

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.300
well, greening how we do digital.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.340
It seemed like a relatively straightforward thing.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.460
So that's what I do.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:50.180
And so, yeah, basically, bits of coding and evangelism stuff with the Green Web Foundation

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:56.880
and a grab bag of mixed stuff, which tends to be Python in many cases, because it's what's

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.580
become the language I'm most comfortable working in.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.840
And it's useful because it's the second most popular language in the world now.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.820
So the chances are that things have been implemented by someone who's thought about it longer than

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:06.080
you have.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:06.500
Absolutely.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.420
There's so many different libraries you can grab.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.040
Those are a bunch of cool projects and organizations.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:16.700
So the Green Web Foundation idea is one day the internet will run entirely on renewable energy,

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.140
and they develop tools to help speed that up, right?

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.340
So you're helping them with that.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:25.400
And then the Climate Action is a global community of tech professionals using their expertise to

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.460
support solutions for climate change.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.700
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.020
Nice.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.160
You'll have to give me the link to your newsletter so I can put it in the show so people can

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:33.380
subscribe to it.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:33.880
Yeah, absolutely.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:39.920

Get started by visiting talkpython.fm/brilliant, or just click the link in your podcast player.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:35.880
Let's talk about climate change at the high level just before we dive into how can we write

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:41.560
code that alleviates that pressure and maybe is a better citizen of the world, digitally speaking,

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.880
and also the real effects that it actually has.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.480
And you talked about all this using energy, in particular electricity, right?

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.980
Servers running electricity, MacBooks running electricity.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:56.820
There's a lot of negative news here, but one of the things that I see as a real sliver of hope,

00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.860
let's put it like that, in terms of this part of the slice, is electricity is awesome because

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:08.060
it often does come from nasty sources like burning coal, but it can come from solar panels.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:08.920
It can come from wind.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.880
It can come from, right?

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.220
It can come from renewable places.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.260
So it's like, you don't have to change anything.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:17.360
You don't have to change anything at all to completely turn all that stuff to renewable

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.100
foundations.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.260
You just need to change the generation of it, right?

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:21.680
Yes.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.440
If it was like airplanes are a serious problem, right?

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.760
Or cars, we're working on electric cars.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.300
We're getting there.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.940
But it's diesel trucks.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.300
It's super hard to just say, well, all you got to do is plug it into a different source.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:37.060
Like, no, diesel comes from a place where it's really hard to make that carbon neutral or

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:37.620
renewable, right?

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.120
So in some sense, the story around tech climate is kind of positive in that regard,

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:42.460
I think.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.080
What do you do?

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:43.220
Yeah.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:49.120
I'm really, really glad you started and started framing it this way, because I think it's really

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:55.140
important for us to realize that a lot of the things that we know and love, like the

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.540
internet, for example, it doesn't need to be running on fossil fuels.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:05.140
And what you spoke about before was the issue is, in many cases, it's our use of fossil fuels

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:10.440
and where we get energy from, not necessarily some of the kind of life choices we make.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:15.760
Like, yes, there is obviously going to be consequences of burning huge amounts of fossils if we, say,

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.220
if we're flying across the Atlantic every second week, for example.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:24.460
But if there is a way to basically do that without the CO2 emissions from burning fossil

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:29.620
fuels, and increasingly, we are seeing options to make that possible, then I think it's actually

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:34.000
that suggests to us that there's actually a kind of more positive future that we can have

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:34.860
available to us.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:39.520
And when you, I don't know about you folks, but I don't remember the internet changing or

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:44.000
my experience of Google changing when they switched to green power or when Facebook switched

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.340
to running on renewable power.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.260
It's not like the internet started juddering to a halt and it started working different.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.140
It used to be really fast, but now it's kind of clunky.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.300
It doesn't quite burn as well or whatever.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.140
No, it's not a steam engine, right?

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:55.820
It's electricity.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.180
Beautiful.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.220
Yeah, this is the thing.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:00.960
I mean, this is actually, when we zoom out outside of technology, you'll see that there's

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.900
a whole conversation around how do we address some of the wider scales?

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.120
And there is this phrase kind of electrification.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.560
Like, we need to electrify a lot of the sources of energy that we use because a lot of it comes

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.820
down to our use of energy, not fossil fuels.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:19.400
But we have, in many cases, kind of grown up with this idea that the only way you can

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.400
get energy is from fossil fuels.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:27.380
And even when it comes to something like aviation, there are actually ways where you can use, say,

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:32.780
excess electricity to create the kind of chemical energy in a way that you could use for, say,

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:38.280
something which needs a high amount of energy density, like, say, flying or trucks or something

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:38.780
like that.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:45.160
The only problem is we often, or for the last 40 or 100 years or so, we've been not really

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:50.140
accounting for all the costs of getting fossil fuels out of the ground and put them into the sky.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:57.060
And as a result, we default to basically drilling for fossil fuels when there are other better ways

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:02.980
of experiencing a lot of the same upsides without the unintended consequences that end up causing

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:03.840
avoidable harm.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:09.780
Yeah, I totally agree. This whole externality thing is frustrating, for sure. You know, Elon Musk,

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:15.680
as much as he does crazy stuff and is kind of weird in some ways, I'm a fan of how he's pushing some of

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:20.880
these ideas forward around like electric cars and so on and solar panels. He came out and said, look,

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:26.460
if we just took some part of the Southwest United States, like Arizona or something, I think maybe he

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:31.020
said Nevada, he said, Nevada, and just took 100 square miles and just covered it in solar panels, that's enough

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:36.580
energy for the entire United States. He also threw in, I don't know, like a five mile square battery or something

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:41.880
ridiculous to carry us through the night. But, you know, I only know that in terms of the US energy, but that's a huge

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:48.660
amount of energy used by the world. It doesn't seem like we as collective citizens of the world are incapable of

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:54.300
generating that much renewable energy. It just seems like a matter of will, almost, because surely we could

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:59.300
create enough solar panels to cover 100 square miles. Like we paved the earth constantly, right? And that's

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.320
way more work or, you know, whatever, right? I mean, it just seems like there are these steps that we could

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:09.040
take that would not be, they're not science fiction. We've got to like create a Dyson sphere around the

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.280
whole universe or hold the solar system and channel it back. No, it's just like, it's pretty attainable.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.540
So I think this is one of the things that I find both frustrating and inspiring when we have these

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.080
conversations, because you've mentioned Elon Musk, and it's very easy for us to immediately kind of

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.760
reach for the closest figure to Ironman that we can think of. Yeah, exactly. And like when I grew up

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.740
totally like, yeah, he's like Ironman, but his stuff is open source. This is awesome, right? Like we think

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:37.300
about this, but it's also, and when you look at things like the effect, the impact that say, well, just

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.680
the kind of like mindset that people think about when it comes to things like EVs and making that

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.260
reality, that's really, really, really good. But you've touched on a few really, really important

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.840
and interesting things. You need to be able to look things that are kind of more systemic level.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.560
Like there's a reason why you have these things. And in many cases, it's not down to us not having

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:58.100
the technology because we do have the technology. Like right now in 2019, we have seen the cost of

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:06.000
batteries fall by something like, I think more than 85% or around 85% since 2010. And we've seen an even

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.660
steeper fall when it comes to solar panels. So it's not like these things are, and to the extent

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:17.680
now that in many cases, deploying new solar is cheaper than continuing to run coal or continuing

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.800
to run gas-fired power stations and things like that now. And in Europe, for example, which is where I'm

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.400
from and where I'm most familiar, more than half of the coal-fired power stations that we have now are

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:34.220
running at a loss simply because people have started pricing into taking, you know, more accurately pricing

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.800
the unintended consequences of coal as well.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:42.760
Even in the US where the current administration is doing everything they can to prop up coal,

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:48.020
there's still tons, like many, many large coal plants shutting down for the same reason you're

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.400
talking about. And you're going to talk about the UK.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:54.700
Yeah. Yeah. I was going to talk about the UK because the UK and the US are, so the UK has been one of the

00:23:54.700 --> 00:24:00.500
fastest countries in Europe to decarbonize its energy, its electricity to the point now that I think

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:05.080
recently we've got around 40% of the grid being powered by renewables.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:10.740
The often, and this is a, in many cases, this is because essentially it's become so expensive to

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:15.500
run fossil fuels. And you've seen that and you're seeing a similar thing in America. America's emissions

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.200
or like a, you know, for every kind of unit of electricity is actually falling quite, it has been

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.080
falling pretty quickly. If we just looked at the kind of economics, it would probably be falling even

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:30.320
faster. But in many cases, you have cases where basically there is a, you don't have that, you

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:36.880
have political support to kind of slow down a transition away from a dirty, harmful fuel, which

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:42.120
employs, I think there are more hairdressers than coal miners in America now. Right. So we have these

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:46.820
ridiculous kinds of figures, you know, propping up these industries at the expense of, you know,

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:52.020
hundreds of that millions of jobs in other industries here. And I kind of think that we need

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:56.600
to like, when we spoke about Elon Musk here, right, I think there's a degree that yes, it's really cool

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.500
that we have electronic cars, but we also got to think about, well, if we are going to be doing,

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:06.860
if we're going to give someone all the props for that, and basically kind of seeing them like some

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:11.900
kind of Ironman, but open source kind of hero, hero figure, then I think it's fair for us to expect

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:17.000
them to be a bit consistent about how they, about who they support politically, and who they,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.040
and who they fund. And if they're going to be funding groups, which basically slow down climate action,

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:25.040
then I think we need to be prepared to say, hey, it's cool that you're building electric cars,

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.980
but can you not do the thing which stops us moving away from fossil fuels? Yeah, because I think it's

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:35.260
we're adults, and we need to be able to have these complex thoughts on our minds. And we also need to be brave

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:40.120
enough to actually address the scale of the situation, because there a lot of it is really,

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:46.800
really freaking scary. But we are capable of addressing this and facing this, if we as long as we actually

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.860
just are basically a bit more rational about it in many cases.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:54.660
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I totally agree. And it's really interesting how it's not really a

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:59.320
technology problem, right? It's a technology challenge, but it's not like it's incapable.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:03.560
It's not like we have to envision, we have to invent vision or something like that, right?

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:09.200
Now, I guess let's just round out this really, this sort of high level view just by pointing out that I

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:15.120
think yesterday, it was yesterday that Greta Thunberg, the young girl from, is she from Sweden?

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.060
One of the Nordic countries.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.780
Yes, one of the Nordics, yeah.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:24.200
Like climate activists. She was voted or made the time person of the year, which is pretty

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:28.020
interesting. So that I think kind of speaks to a little bit of, you know, people are starting to

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:28.560
pay attention.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:35.460
Absolutely. I am. She's so, so cool. I'm so, so pleased. And I find this, this child inspiring.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:40.080
I think we need to be able to be prepared to be able to say, yeah, the actions of these people,

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:45.220
and them having that kind of moral clarity and consistency, I think is really, really inspiring

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:50.840
for the rest of us. And like, we don't all need to be Greta, but I think there are the things she

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:55.960
asks us to do, but basically, Hey, I'm a kid adults. Can you pay attention to the science and do something

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:02.200
with this and basically act like adults? I think that's something that we can respond to. And I

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.340
think that speaks to a part of us, which I feel that we, you know, if we look inside ourselves,

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:12.320
we can answer and work in a kind of responsible kind of authentic way. So yeah, it's really,

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:18.020
nice to see that. And I, and I think that we need people like that to be reminding us of what

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.500
our responsibilities are as adults are really.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.540
Yeah, absolutely. So let's bring this back to software, right? That's why we're here talking

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:30.040
about this because as software developers or people that use computing in significant ways,

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.820
there's actually a lot of concrete stuff that we can do. And code runs everywhere. Code runs on our

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:40.200
phones, code runs on our laptops, but a lot of code, more than people realize, I think runs on data

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.800
centers. And so there's an interesting stat that I got from Forbes. I think this is, yeah,

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:50.800
this is only for the U S but the U S data centers use 90 billion kilowatt hours of electricity a year,

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:57.640
which is roughly equivalent to 34 giant coal powered plants. And I think this is 3% of all

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:02.260
either energy or electricity consumption in the United States. Yeah. Total electricity, 3%.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:06.860
Okay. So these numbers actually feel, is this maybe low? no, these numbers are actually,

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:12.440
yeah, there are, I mean, I was, so this is, you, you get a number of different estimates for this

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:18.400
ranging from like 200 gigawatts, which I think is a billion kilowatts, a hundred gig in a gigawatts,

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:24.520
or 200 gigawatts. It kind of ranges. The estimates vary depending on who you look at.

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:29.540
Right. Does the data center inside a company count or maybe only public data centers or what do they

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.660
count? Right. It could really vary who they're counting there. Yeah. So it's kind of mind blowing,

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:39.020
right? I was at, in my role as someone working with the Greenberg foundation, I ended up at this

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:45.100
event, which, was organized, a workshop organized by the European commission on how they're going to do

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:49.900
green public procurement. Because in Europe, they spend something in the region of 45 billion euros each

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:55.780
year on technology and, they want to do that in a more, in a fashion, which is more in line with

00:28:55.780 --> 00:29:01.200
the science. And when in line with the fact that they have basically declared a climate emergency as

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:06.700
like the block of Europe. So the, because they too have realized that the internet runs on

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:11.240
electricity and servers run electricity, they want to work out how to do this. And even inside that,

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.640
when you've got people from Amazon, Google, Microsoft, all of these places, they are still trying to

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:19.260
like saying, Oh, we need a definition of cloud that we can use across this. We need a definition of

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:24.040
what data centers are. And it's kind of bonkers that you do have, you have this ambiguity. And

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:29.180
when you see these numbers, lots of the studies, they will have often use slightly different definitions

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:33.520
of the same thing. Like, does it include Bitcoin mining? Does it not? Is that a data center? Is it

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.440
not a data center? Because that kind of power profile is different to how you might use something else.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:43.100
So it's a long story short is basically these numbers you've shared are, they're not wildly out.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:48.080
And, the figures that people tend to use for data centers and like the internet in general,

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:55.120
or like a kind of tech is between 2% and 4% of, well, between one and 4% of all CO2 emissions.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:00.140
So that's in the same ballpark figure as all of shipping or all of aviation.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:03.140
Yeah, exactly. All flying is like 2.5 or something like that. Yeah.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:07.860
Yeah. Or Germany. So like, these are like significant numbers and just for like a streaming

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:14.000
video, for example, the figures we see from a recent report by the shift project, they say, well,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.620
all streaming video, that's about the same carbon footprint as Spain, like the country of Spain.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:24.620
Yeah. And it's cats. It's like viral videos, right? No, of course not all of it.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:31.140
Actually, I know. it's crazy. I like a quarter of that is porn. All right. So a quarter of Spain is

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.540
porn, right? And it's just, yeah, you like the numbers are mind blowing when you look at this,

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:40.480
because we tend not to really be thinking about this kind of stuff because we are so

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:45.420
cause program, because we've done such a good job of abstracting the eventual kind of

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.180
implementation details of whatever it is that we're doing that we're not aware of this stuff.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:53.640
One of the feelings that I have that is like a realization that blows my mind is I can go sit

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.100
in a coffee shop or somewhere with my MacBook and I have a pretty high end MacBook, but even if it was

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.700
like just a MacBook air, right, I could sit there and I could write my code. I have a little database

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:05.540
server running and get the web app working and whatnot. And then I push a button and

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:10.680
and it goes out and runs on incredible high end servers and massive data centers with like

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:15.080
its own database server and you know, the web front end. And, and it's just like,

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:19.360
it's almost like a disconnect for me that I can work on these little tiny devices and I push a

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.760
button and then it's like this great big thing. And of course, I mean, it could scale huge, right?

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.020
Like I could, I could scale that out to a hundred servers that for some reason that was a thing.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:29.760
And it's really easy to disconnect that from your mind to like, I'm actually running a hundred

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.980
desktop type things when I just push, push deploy, right?

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:37.700
Oh yeah, you're right. And like, this is, but it's, it's worth being worth being aware that in

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:42.400
many cases that when you put something into the cloud, for example, like over the last say few

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:48.520
years, like at least five years, actual energy usage that was reported by the IEA, the international

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:54.660
energy agency, they've generally said that emissions have been like, so energy use has roughly been

00:31:54.660 --> 00:32:00.780
pretty stable in America, at least largely because this has been this massive growth or move from lots and

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:05.140
not sort of relatively inefficient data centers to the cloud, but cloud is massively more efficient.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:10.340
Right. You have a virtual machine and it's, it's sharing that CPU and that hardware with many other

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:14.840
virtual machines, rather than having a hardware device in my own company's data center.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:20.840

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.880
There is also a flip side to this. And there's a guy and so there's a gentleman called William

00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:02.260
Stanley Jevons. 200 years ago, he observed the same impact that we see now when he was looking at how

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:07.840
steam engines were becoming more and more efficient. They were like every individual new generation of

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:12.620
steam engine uses much less coal for the same amount of work. So that's going to result in a kind of fall

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:17.860
in coal usage by the industry. Right. And it turned out not to be the case. It turned out to be the,

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:22.920
it was called William, the Jevons paradox is the phrase. We might also call it the rebound effect

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:27.200
in some cases where as you make something more efficient, you end up seeing more use of it.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.700
So the total amount grows even higher. If you want to sound really posh, you can call it the

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:36.500
Kazum Brooks postulate. And that's one for Wikipedia, right? And that sounds really, really posh. But

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:42.280
basically, as things get more efficient, we end up using them more, which can often result in greater

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:47.720
emissions. If we do not find a way to decouple the emissions, basically, there's a line and

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.440
you need to, there's a degree at which it ends up with more emissions or not emissions.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.940
And this is kind of why tech in many cases is being presented as one of the kind of wonderful

00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:00.300
hopes of the future. Because if we could only find a way to make better use of the tools we have,

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:05.540
often through technology, then there's a chance that we could kind of steer this economy away from

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:09.860
the iceberg and into something more like, I don't know, Star Trek than Mad Max, I suppose.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:17.820
Yeah, let's definitely stay away from Mad Max. Now, you've given a couple of presentations on this,

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:22.020
and I'll link to those in the show notes. You've got the slides up, and those are really helpful

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:26.640
with cool pictures. One company that you called out that I use for credit card, when people buy

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:30.880
courses on my platform, it goes through Stripe. The company you called out is Stripe for being a good

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:35.060
citizen on how they report and account for their emissions. Can you talk to that real quick?

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:39.440
Yes. I'm wary about kind of diving too deeply into this. And it's probably useful to have the slide

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:43.700
that we are going to refer to. But if an organization is going to talk about carbon,

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:47.540
or talk about being kind of environmentally responsible, if they're not really talking

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:51.600
about scoped emissions, then they're kind of doing it wrong. All right. Because this is generally

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:58.820
considered the sensible way to talk about it. And you have three main kinds of scopes, which are

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:04.020
generally kind of considered ways to account for emissions from different things you do. So scope one might be

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:09.260
emissions from you burning fossil fuels yourself. I've burned 100 gallons of gas. So that's my

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:14.540
carbon footprint. Yeah. Yeah. The example I use in talks is coffee, because lots of us like coffee.

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:19.920
So if you burn gas to heat up a kettle to make coffee, that's like scope one emissions, right?

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:25.540
Scope two is emissions from electricity that you use. So that might be someone else miles away burning

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:31.420
coal so that you can use a kettle to heat up some water to make coffee. All right. So companies like,

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:35.900
Amazon and Google, who tend to use a lot of electricity, they're going to have very,

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.060
very high scope two emissions in most cases.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:41.500
Right. Because some is lost on the wire, there's some inefficiencies at the plant,

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.320
all that kind of stuff, right?

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:46.460
Yeah, absolutely. And that kind of speaks to the fact that a lot of us don't tend to,

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:51.460
like we don't physically burn coal ourselves to power a computer, but someone's burning it

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:55.840
somewhere in our behalf, right? So in many cases, that might be kind of those large companies scope

00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:00.820
two emissions. And we wouldn't really have very high scope one emissions ourselves in many cases.

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:05.720
But scope three is the kind of biggest source of emissions for most of us. And the slide that I

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:10.480
think you're referring to shows Stripe having quite low scope one and scope two, which makes sense,

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:17.660
because they are large, large customers of kind of cloud giants. So therefore, scope three is basically,

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:23.260
the example I use is imagine you're walking into Starbucks and paying for coffee. So someone somewhere

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:28.480
has burned fossil fuels to generate the heat to make that coffee or to make sure you're in a nice,

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.960
warm space. So it's kind of in your supply chain, really, that needs to exist for you to make coffee.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:39.080
And for most of us, our emissions are going to be in scope three, because we are mostly purchasing

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:43.720
services and selling services to other people, if we're developers rather than, I don't know,

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.160
miners ourselves, you know?

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:48.320
Right, right. There's a lot of knock on effects out in three, right? Like,

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:53.020
we've got to fund the military who sends a bunch of people to some unstable place. And

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:58.400
how much carbon do they spend to just ensure political stability so that then the oil company

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:02.640
can send, you know, a bunch of machines over there to mine it up and ship it? Like, there's a lot of

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.260
stuff happening that's not just the carbon captured in that, you know, bit of oil.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:06.680
Yes.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:10.740
We should think about this for basically our code as well, is what you're saying.

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:11.180
Yeah.

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:16.680
As developers, I think the concept that we have a dependency chain to the stuff we do

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:21.680
shouldn't be an alien one. Like, we're continually using dependencies from lots of other people.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:26.340
And this is how people in the kind of climate world think about dependency chains, really.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:31.180
Because this is something that we're used to using anyway. Like, if we have a requirements.text file,

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.800
then there's something happening there that we're aware of. So intuitively, it should be

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.980
something that we can kind of internalize as a concept, really. It's just that we tend not to

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:40.060
quantify this.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:45.040
Yeah. I mean, that was sort of what my example of the coffee shop push was. It's kind of like,

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:49.240
it's so easy to, like, it stops here. You know what I mean? But it really, that's just the beginning.

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:53.560
To be concrete, you have some interesting mental models that you talk about that help bring this and

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.160
think about it and some tools we're going to talk about and some steps. So you have platform,

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:01.260
which is the infrastructure that you run, right? This is, I guess, the cloud directly,

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:07.900
a lot of times. Packets, which is the stuff that flows between you and your other services or

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:12.700
people who are considering them. And then process about how your organization works, which is maybe

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.840
a little more tangential to that. So let's start a platform.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:22.100
Yeah. Okay. So I've tried to take this concept of scopes and find some kind of comparison for

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:27.080
what you might do as a developer or as a kind of tech professional, because it feels like speaking

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:31.360
about scopes is often quite abstract for a lot of us. And it kind of makes sense to

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:36.540
talk about things we would use ourselves. So I talk about packets, because in many cases,

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:40.660
a lot of us, that might be infrastructure that you might use yourself or the servers that you run.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:45.340
And when you have something like that, you've got kind of like levers. So one lever might be how you

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:50.140
provision the infrastructure that you use to kind of meet demand. And, you know, we could go back to

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:54.760
examples where you used to kind of physically provision servers in a rack. And then you just hope that

00:38:54.760 --> 00:39:00.020
you and your provision for the most possible load, because it's going to be really hard to scale that up.

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.700
Right. Right. Especially if you have to buy machines. And like you said, put them in a rack.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:09.380
If on Fridays, you have to handle 100 concurrent requests, but most times it's 10, you buy machines

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.380
for 120 and you run them all the time.

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:11.540
Yeah, exactly.

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:12.020
Probably.

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:16.740
Yeah. And most of the time that results in you, because computers don't scale all the way down,

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:21.840
you're basically burning loads of money. But it turns out that because computers use fossil fuels,

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:27.780
a lot of the time they're burning lots of fossil fuels. There are unintended consequences to that,

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:33.180
which result in lots and lots of CO2 emissions. And yeah, you have that. And as we've got better

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:37.520
at provisioning, or if you are a kind of developer, the way you might provision might have an impact.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.200
So rather than having a giant, giant physical server, one thing you might do instead is have

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:47.040
some kind of scaling thing or working with VMs or dockers or whatever thing that makes it possible

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.420
to kind of scale that way. That's one way.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:49.980
Yeah.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.580
Like Kubernetes is pretty easy for them.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:56.120
It also seems to me, I would like to hear your thoughts on this, that if you're purchasing

00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:00.460
VMs in the cloud, I know there's other stuff like serverless and so on that kind of does this

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:04.860
automatically. But if you're say purchasing, I guess even Docker, but if you're purchasing say servers

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:10.380
and virtual machines, you can buy them or provision them with dedicated CPUs so that you're guaranteed

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:16.220
to have that CPU core available for you, or you can do it with shared. And I feel a little bit like

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:21.340
if you go and buy the dedicated server, fully dedicated CPU machine, you're kind of locking

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:25.920
out that thing to run all the time, right? Because you've got 12 cores, only 12 people can buy

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:30.540
dedicated machines on that and that's it. Whereas if you're in the more floating kind, you might

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:34.900
suffer a little bit in performance, but it's definitely going to scale down massively when

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.100
it's not busy because it's going to be able to share that with other VMs. What do you think?

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:42.600
It's a bit like, okay, let's just use the example of cars, right? I could buy, if I run a business,

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:47.980
I could have like 12 cars, yeah? Or I could like pay for a taxi service to scale up, to scale the

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:52.480
amount of things I'm using at any one point, right? Yes, you having to purchase exclusive use of

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:58.220
something will do that. And in many cases, we will make that decision. But in many cases, we, there's

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.800
going to be, there'll be trade-offs that we make and there'll be consequences of us doing that kind

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:06.680
of stuff. And it's very difficult to really kind of give specific guidance on this because it's going

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:11.040
to rely so much on context. And this is why I think in many cases, we kind of need to be able

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:16.060
to understand the full cost of what we do and understand that and be able to make those judgments

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:22.060
in an informed way. Because in many cases, there is an argument for using something like say serverless,

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:26.520
where the kind of economics and the incentives are aligned much, much better.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:31.700
Right. Serverless, it doesn't even run at all if it's idle, right? It only processes the demand.

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:37.640
Yes. So that's good in some ways. I mean, to be honest, the amount of the kind of energy savings

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:43.860
that come from that, it's quite difficult to really quantify because most of the large organizations that

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:48.100
do provide this tend not to be prepared to share these numbers. And if there are groups who can

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:53.700
share these numbers, it would be fantastic for the good of science because even the professors say,

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:57.280
we don't know either. Like no one knows right now. And it's very difficult.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:02.600
It's all these giant corporate places that data serve, the whole data center infrastructure.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:07.720
That's a huge area of competitive advantage. They're making their own hardware. They're doing

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:11.800
all sorts of crazy stuff around cooling and energy. I mean, they don't want to share that. Why would

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.440
they want to share that?

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:17.780
Yeah. And like you see this now, even when, absolutely. And even down to just like how long

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:23.220
you hold on to servers in the first place. Like you might assume that in many cases, you, you know,

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:27.240
we might hold, we might assume a server, which takes a lot of energy to turn into a server.

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:32.040
Cause remember like chips are sand initially, right? Like there's a lot of energy from turning

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:37.520
sand into a server or the chips right there. Like we don't really think about it until it's not

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.220
something we have to face, but yeah, there's going to be a member because if energy is coming from fossil

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:44.840
fuels and it doesn't need to, but often does, then that's where there's going to be lots of emissions.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:49.280
If you have a server, which only lasts, if people are swapping out servers every year versus every

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.700
three years, that's going to have an impact on the calculations that you actually might have.

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.580
So yes, you're, you're absolutely right there.

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:58.980
So one question I have about serverless, like on the face value, it seems obviously that's

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:02.940
going to be better than VMs. Let's say the shared kind, right? I mean, the dedicated ones clearly

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:08.520
are just constantly running, but it also seems to me like each individual requests might take a lot

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:13.520
more energy because it's got to maybe start up some kind of Docker. It's not just running a few lines

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:18.540
of code and already running process. It's every one of those is kind of a fresh go at a new environment.

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:21.820
So even though you can scale infinitely, cause you could hit a hundred thousand servers.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:27.360
You hit that hard enough, right? But that may per request cost more. There's just like an

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.000
interesting trade-off that I was thinking about as we were talking about this.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.960
Yeah. I mean, this is exactly what you see with servers anyway, right? Like we know that if you,

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:39.380
if you're going to buy a physical server, then I mean, when, when Amazon, when various,

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:42.680
when kind of cloud computing products came out in the first place, you know, people say,

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.760
Hey, that, why, why would I spend money on cloud when I can buy a server to give me those,

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:51.060
the same resources over a longer period for less money? Like you're paying for the flexibility and

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:55.160
you're paying for the fact that you don't have a giant great server to kind of decommission at the

00:43:55.160 --> 00:44:01.280
end of three or five years or something. So in most cases, there will be a higher per request trade-off,

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:05.720
but with the idea being that you're not, you pay slightly more per request for the flexibility

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:11.420
and the efficiency at kind of systemic level, I suppose. But once again, who knows for sure?

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:15.220
Yeah. Who knows? I would, I would guess that serverless is more efficient in terms of energy

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:20.160
in general, but, but I don't really know. All right. So one thing I do want to talk about in this

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:25.560
area is, you have some tools, like at each one of these three levels, you have tools in the

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:30.880
Python toolbox, stuff that you can run or things you can do or libraries you can use. So maybe tell us

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.180
about the ones that you have for this and I'll throw in a few that I came up with as well.

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:39.300
Yeah. Okay. So basically any tool that can track the amount of CPU usage you're using can also give

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:43.540
you an idea because energy uses fossil fuels, what the climate impacts of a lot of this stuff will

00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:47.220
actually be. You know, there is now a moral argument for basically optimizing your code

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:51.480
because, so like that is good news for developers who like performance, right?

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:56.580
Right. You already want fast code now because it means you can, obviously users want it because

00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:01.240
faster software feels better and more professional. You want it because it's fewer machines to manage.

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:07.000
it costs less. The data centers want it. And then of course that's all lined up with CO2 emissions.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:13.080
You found this thing called energy dash usage, which is an NPM tool, right? You can run.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:15.020
This is actually from, this is a Python.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:18.740
Oh, Python. Okay. Uh-huh. Oh, it's another one down later. That's NPM, right?

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:24.060
Yeah. So this was designed specifically to address the, I think it was designed as a response to

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:29.660
basically revelations amongst people who are working in technology, working with say AI that, the

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:34.320
kind of, you know, we speak about Moore's law, like it doubles every 18 months, right? So that is,

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.500
you know, you know, we see some kind of changing impacts there. I think a year and a half ago,

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:43.460
a paper was released with, showing that the kind of average amount of compute used to achieve

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:48.160
various kinds of goals or breakthroughs with, with AI is doubling every three and a half months.

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:52.860
Right. And, over, I think over a two year period, please don't, I'll share the link

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:58.320
specifically, but because of this, this doubling feature is, it basically results in massively more

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:03.100
energy use. So the point that like something like that might double seven times in the set period,

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.580
if you're looking at a three and a half month doubling period compared to 18 months,

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:13.340
it's like 200 X, 200,000 X versus seven X. So you're seeing like a big increase. And, this

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:18.900
was generated. This Python module is basically a tool to allow you to kind of profile some code.

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:23.800
It'll give you an idea of the emissions associated, the energy usage for that by kind of reading some of

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:29.000
the energy usage stuff from some, some, some, I think from some Intel processors share this,

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.640
and then they converted that to the CO2 per kilowatt hour, for example.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:36.400
Right. And then it ties it back to where like you're actually located even.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:41.200
Yeah, absolutely. That's what it does. And this was designed for people working with machine

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:46.600
learning to get an idea of what algorithms are going to have an impact so that you could make

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:51.440
these decisions upfront or be aware of the trade-offs of using one thing over another. Because

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:56.580
as I understand, and I'm not a data scientist, different machine learning tools or approaches

00:46:56.580 --> 00:47:02.200
use wildly different amounts of compute. And this was designed as a tool to show you that. And there's

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:06.500
also a whole kind of syllabus tied to this because this was shared by a professor

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:10.320
who I follow on Twitter when I saw it. I've totally forgot her, the woman's name who did

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:14.480
it. And I feel I'm really, really embarrassed for forgetting her name, but she's been sharing

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.960
a load of really interesting stuff in this. And this was work from, I think, a group called

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:22.980
Climate Change AI, who invested a bunch of time into this. So yeah, that's one thing that you've

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:23.160
got.

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:26.660
That's really interesting. I'm trying to look up her name as well, but I couldn't find either.

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:32.600
So another thing in this platform part is, like we just mentioned right before, is faster code is more

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:37.600
efficient code, means fewer servers, means smaller servers, and so on. And there's just a bunch of

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:43.080
techniques that you can apply to your code, right? Like if you use a database, make sure you're using

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:48.620
an index. It's not just faster. It uses less energy, right? If it responds in 10 milliseconds versus

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:53.040
a second, that is a whole lot less work it's doing. Not always, but most of the time when your code is

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:59.140
stuck or waiting, it's something in the chain is cranking as hard as it can to get back to you. Maybe if

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:03.580
you're calling a remote service and there's like a 100 millisecond ping time, that's different. But if it's

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:08.020
not far away, the delay is sort of computation time for something, I would suspect.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:14.160
Yeah. So some of the concrete examples that I think that might be of some use here would be, and you could

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:18.120
kind of like take a leaf out of some of the nodes book, right? When you have things like

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:23.500
async, if you've got a way of working where you're not blocking and you're able to serve another

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:27.760
request, then theoretically you don't need to be running quite so many machines to do the same

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:33.300
amount of work. Absolutely. If you're using the async and await-based frameworks like Sanic or some

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:38.080
of those, yeah. Yeah. So there are some ways that you can, basically anything that tend to improve

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:42.860
performance, because you're generally using fewer resources to achieve the same kind of result,

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:48.080
it makes a lot of sense. So yeah, you already know these techniques in many cases,

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:53.160
if you're working with Python, for example, and some of the things are directly applicable.

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:57.600
Right. And sometimes people don't bother because it's not slow enough. You know, if you have a

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:02.740
pretty busy web page that loads in 100 milliseconds, but the load is not so high, it's still fast enough,

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:05.960
right? You don't need to necessarily optimize it. But if you could get it down to 25,

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.340
it would use a quarter of the energy, right? Yeah.

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:13.000
Like, so profile your code and see where it's at. And just, I don't know, just put that as one of the

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.580
trade-offs you think about as you build code and care about it.

00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:18.960
Yeah. And this is partly, this is a nice kind of takes us back to the kind of platform packets

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:23.660
process thing that I was just talking about before. So I found platform as a useful thing to talk about.

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:28.260
And like, we've been doing some work with an agency. Actually, there's a group called the Panoply.

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:33.480
They're a kind of transformation agency in the UK. And we did some work as the Greenway Foundation to

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:37.460
basically help them think about how they build, do run digital projects and where,

00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:42.180
and we started looking at some of their own projects. And we found that like the platform

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:46.040
part was quite a significant chunk from at least one of the projects they're working on. But there

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:50.460
are also other leverage points that they had, like the packets part and the process stuff.

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:54.640
Yeah. Yeah. Let's talk about packets because that's way harder for us to understand how we pull

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:58.200
those levers. I can choose the type of server I get. I write the code that runs.

00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:04.400
I could decide serverless or virtual servers, but I can't decide how my packets get from my server in

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:10.760
New York to you over where you are, right? I can't control that part of the world. Or can I?

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:15.300
No. I mean, well, okay. So there's a dream we have. Yeah. There's a dream like, because if you

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:20.340
actually look into the networks, like there seems like BGP, which control how packets get rooted around.

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:24.620
And if you had knowledge about which kind of parts of the internet are run on green power,

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:29.000
then in the wonderful world, in a perfect world, you might have some kind of green BGP

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.140
that knows and favors the greener nodes more than the other nodes.

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:35.400
Right. Not just use latency or something like that.

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:35.660
Yeah.

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:39.520
But until this one gets bad, we're going to flow through this part of the world because

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:45.080
this is the best possible path in terms of CO2 to get this from America to Europe or something.

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:48.560
Well, yeah. So there is, I mean, this is one of the reasons we, at the Green Web Foundation,

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:53.280
we've started releasing open data sets in the hope that someone might take this idea and do something

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:57.080
cool with it. Because so we've got like, we're working on a thing called IP2Green, which will

00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:00.300
basically, and there's another thing called GreenTrace, where we're basically building trace

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:04.560
route that hops and shows you whether hops are green or not green, based on what the information

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:07.480
that we have available to ourselves to make something of this possible.

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:12.260
But this is like way in the future, because we're quite a small group. And we were at the

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:16.900
kind of wouldn't it be cool if stage at the moment. But if anyone is interested in doing something like

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:21.460
this, I would love to chat about it in more detail. But until then, yeah, you're right, because you

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:25.900
don't have direct control over the internet. And to be honest, for many of us, that's a feature. And I

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:30.460
think as a feature, because, you know, we root around lots of things. And we know you by treating

00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:34.700
censorship like damage, for example, it's good. But it means that because you can't control things

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:39.460
directly, you have to control things indirectly. So you might resort to other techniques that we

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:40.160
already have.

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:45.840
Yeah, and there are a bunch. So there's two, let's start with the projects. There's a project from

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:52.420
Google called Lighthouse. And the idea is it measures the effective user oriented performance

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:57.300
of your web application. And I've spoken about Lighthouse a little bit before I came across this.

00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:02.420
And I thought, you know, my sites are super fast. If you go into the web logs, and you look at it,

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:07.320
it says it's sending the response out the door in 10, 15 milliseconds. And I thought, well,

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:11.540
how much more can I improve over 10 milliseconds? You know, no one is going to perceive that,

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:15.780
whatever. And I'll throw it in here. Let's just see how it does. I threw it in there. And it said,

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:21.380
your site is average to slow. What is this thing talking about? Like, no, there's no, what is it

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:26.280
doing? And it considers all these different things that the user perceives. And I spent days rebuilding

00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:31.900
all my sites. So I can get it up now to almost 100. Sometimes on a good day, I can get it to hit 100

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:37.640
out of 100. But the idea is it has very concrete steps. And it says you should do things like you

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:42.660
should resize this image to exactly the size that's being displayed instead of shipping a huge one and

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:49.180
letting the site, the client do it. You should use gzip on your stuff you're exchanging on your HTML and

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:54.560
your CSS. You should use really proper caching. All of these things are good. And they're all

00:52:54.560 --> 00:53:00.220
perceived by the user to be awesome. So if I have, you know, 100k of CSS, maybe not that much, but a lot

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:05.240
of CSS and a lot of JavaScript, if you only request it once, but you hit the site 100 times rather than

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:10.460
over and over and over again, that is a huge amount of traffic you're alleviating, right? So this tool

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:14.700
actually is really good for controlling what you put on the wire. This is one of the levers that you do have.

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:20.280
And what we decided to do was basically fork this. So we took Lighthouse, forked it, made it refer to

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:24.220
say which parts of the websites were green, and we called it Greenhouse. So it's a plugin. So

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:28.560
anywhere that you use Lighthouse, you can use this to get an idea of which parts of your supply chain

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:32.980
or your dependency chain are running on renewable power. And the thing that we're also doing with

00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:37.720
this is to convert some of this. We haven't implemented this yet, but we actually have the data out there and

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:42.080
we've been doing it with some consulting clients. So basically, take this and give people rough ideas of the

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:46.720
CO2 emissions from doing this. But absolutely, like basically green websites are usually good

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:50.900
websites because they're fast and they make good use of the resources that we do already have. And

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:55.720
once again, we already know how to do so much of this. And there are clear steps that you can actually

00:53:55.720 --> 00:54:00.540
follow. So yeah, it's a this is kind of what we did. And this is what I've spoken about a few places

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:05.940
before. Like you already have a lot of the tooling already to do this. And in many cases, depending on what

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:10.880
you're building, this may be a more effective place to spend your time than say on say the platform part,

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:16.560
depending on how well optimized your website is or what it's for. And this is this is why it's

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:20.520
important for us as professionals to understand the things and know where we would be where we were

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:26.080
going to spend the limited amounts of time that we do have to improve the full interim experience for

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:26.960
like end users.

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:32.120
Right. And it can be incredibly simple things like turning on caching is oh, I just didn't even realize

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:35.700
that we had forgot to turn on caching for these static files or turning on. Yeah.

00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:41.340
Another one is optimizing images. And I talked about resizing them to the right size. But there's a

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:46.320
bunch of cool programs. The one I use called image optimum. Yeah, I'll link to it. But basically,

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:50.020
you grab a folder, you can just grab your whole website and throw it on there. And it'll traverse

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:54.740
it hierarchically to find all the images. And it applies about 10 different algorithms. Yeah,

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:58.620
to shrink it and it'll shrink it like 50% without even losing inequality. It's ridiculous.

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:04.520
Yes. So there's a there's a woman called Hannah. Oh, God, I forgot. She's on Twitter as Hannah P.

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:09.560
And I'll share the link to her. She said a really good deck all about this information. And it's

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:14.880
that basically explains all these things. There's loads of tools out there that we can use to have a

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:20.260
measurable improvement in a bunch of in this stuff here. And in many cases, like that, I'm glad you

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:24.560
mentioned the compression thing. Because when Netflix did this, they basically half the bandwidth bill

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:29.300
for a bunch for a bunch of the projects that implemented this because we just forgot to kind

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:34.680
of switch on like compress or GZIP in something on the server. And there's actually some open source

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:39.320
plugins to existing servers that will do a bunch of this stuff for you on the fly. If you look through

00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:43.560
the look for the I think Google page speed plugins, you'll see some of this stuff for Apache and for

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:48.740
Nginx. So there's already stuff out there. And there are also services like ordinary that will do this

00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:53.380
stuff. But again, it's worth remembering that useful to know where the impact is going to be because

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:58.020
depending on the usage profile of what you do, this might not be the most effective place to

00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:02.320
invest your time if you're going to be thinking about, I guess, the kind of climate impacts of the

00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:02.900
way we work.

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:06.680
Yeah. It's something as simple as throwing your images into one of these optimizers. That doesn't

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:11.220
take any thought, right? You're not like, well, if I do this, I might break something. You know,

00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:15.400
long as the algorithms are lossless, you really don't have to think at all. You just do it. But if

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.620
they're served millions of times, that's a big deal.

00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:18.880
Yes, absolutely.

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:22.640
Yeah, there's a lot. I guess the point I'm trying to make is there's a lot of low hanging fruit here.

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:25.720
And the tools that you talked about, Lighthouse, which is a plugin for Chrome,

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:30.220
or Google PageSpeed, which I'm linking to in the show notes is the online version. And then the

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.480
greenhouse fork of it that you talked about.

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:32.720
Yeah.

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:35.780
So that was the thing that we have. But there's also, but there's other things as well. There's

00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:39.140
one called sitespeed.io, which is basically like a Docker container. You can literally,

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:44.160
if you can run Docker, you run Docker and then point a URL at it and it will give you a report of all

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:48.420
this stuff automatically. Like you don't, I've referred to some things from Google, but there are other

00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:52.620
tools around there that will help that you can use. And the nice thing that I've seen with

00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:57.240
sitespeed that I really like is that they can give you like, it talks to Grafana and Graphite. So you

00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:02.500
can kind of start charting and graphing this stuff so you can see changes. And I believe they're

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:06.860
announcing GitHub actions. So every single time you make a change, you can see whether it's going to

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:10.200
be an improvement or a regression on what you had previously.

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:14.000
Yeah. Yeah. Very neat. All right. So there's a lot more stuff we could talk about on the packet

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.300
side, but let's just for the sake of time, let's move on to process, which is more about how your

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:24.160
possibly tech company, possibly other company where you do tech stuff works in more general, right?

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:29.240
Yeah. And like, this is actually, this is the one which in many cases is probably some of the biggest

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:34.320
leverage points available to you, but they're often some of the harder ones to actually start because

00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:39.920
they often rely on organizational changes because things like, it's going to be stuff like,

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:45.380
okay, how we think about travel or how we, how we work. I mean, when you look at say the report from,

00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:49.260
if you look at Apple sustainability report, right, you'll, I mean, I've shared a link to it. There's

00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:53.640
a few things that are really interesting. So, because I did in the talk that I gave recently,

00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:57.220
or one of the talks that I've been doing recently is just showing like the emissions from

00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:01.820
large companies that we know and admire. So Amazon kind of emissions from Amazon are roughly

00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:07.100
same size as Finland for 2018, right? The country of Finland has basically the same emissions as

00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:11.880
Amazon, according to their report. Google is about the same footprint as Liberia. So a kind of small

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:18.080
country in Africa and Apple's figures were for the Gambia, right? So that's what I think 0.6 million

00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:22.580
tons of emissions. If you don't include the hardware, like making of iPhones and stuff like that,

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:27.500
if you include that, it's basically Mongolia. So the country of Mongolia, all of the output is

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:32.300
basically all the iPhones and all the things we have there. But if you look at just the non,

00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:38.300
non-electronics part, most of the emissions, like half of that, half of the emissions from Apple is

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:43.200
from business travel. And more than a third comes from employee commuting. Because in many cases,

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:47.140
a lot of, if you look at, you know, Apple's wonderful campus that everyone has to drive to,

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:51.300
you've just embedded. Yes, it's cool that you've got a nice round canvas and stuff. But now if everyone

00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:54.280
has to drive there, there's all these emissions associated with it.

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:59.680
And it's right in the middle of greater San Francisco, which is notoriously gridlocked,

00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:04.020
right? There's just like tons of driving and whatnot there. You know, I mean, from that perspective,

00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:08.140
they could put it somewhere more remote and that would be better because people could live near it.

00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:11.620
But of course, they're not in San Francisco or Silicon Valley. I mean, yeah.

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:15.700
Yeah. Like this is the thing. Like in many cases, lots of remote friendly companies,

00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:18.940
there's a very strong environmental argument for it. Because in addition to it being...

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:20.460
There's a huge one. Yeah, you're right.

00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:25.660
And this is like, I mean, we're basically in the process of like releasing a spreadsheet to kind of

00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:30.200
help you work it, understand the emissions at project level. So you and your team can see where

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:34.060
the levers are that you might actually have. Because on some cases, when we've looked at some

00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:37.960
projects, we found that, oh, wow, getting rid of the video on the front page had the same impact

00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:42.680
of all of our commuting over the last year, for example, depending on the scale of the company,

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:46.700
right? But in some cases, if you're working where there's loads and loads of driving,

00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:51.700
because someone has like a two hour commute each way, then one of the most impactful things you can

00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:56.980
do on a project might just be, yes, we're gonna do remote working better, because we don't need to

00:59:56.980 --> 01:00:01.800
be driving. And it has all kinds of nice side effects. I mean, in many cases, if you think about

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:07.380
how you work, you can have these other kind of what people refer to as co benefits. So remote work will

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:12.420
often make it more accessible to people with kids, for example, or people who might have mobility

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:17.660
problems. There's all these things that we can do, which also end up having things making things a

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:22.200
bit greener, or just things like thinking about how much we do need to fly, for example,

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:27.380
right? Could that meeting be in zoom? Or do I have to fly from New York to London to have it in person,

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:32.280
right? Yeah, Microsoft is a good example of this. They have an internal carbon price on top of their

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:37.700
flights as a disincentive for them doing this. But also they've set up a kind of green cloud advocacy

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:42.280
kind of group now. And also, like this, this was just a few weeks ago, I know, I think it was last

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:46.660
week that it was it became public. But also, one of the people that he was giving a talk at

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:53.040
DevRelCon about kind of low carbon developer relations, like low co DevRel. And one thing he

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:58.040
was looking at doing is he gets the teams to just track the carbon from what they're doing, or if

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:02.800
they're going to fly, make sure they get a good sense of make sure they make the use of that flight

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:06.820
they're going to do make the carbon count, essentially. Yeah, in many cases, it's a there's

01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:11.700
a big argument for just getting better at remote work, which is kind of embarrassing that in tech,

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:16.040
so many of us still aren't all that good at it, really. Yeah, yeah, I did for about 10 years,

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:20.740
I did remote work. And then finally, now I have my own company, I just but I work from a little office

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:24.860
in my house. It's quite nice. Once you get used to it, there's a lot of stuff you got to get used to,

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:29.480
right? Like, you don't want to distractions around the house to mess things up. You don't want to

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:33.740
feel like you're stuck in the office, because it's 8pm. But you're thinking about something,

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:37.520
you go work on it. But at the same time, you got to focus and not just watch TV. There's a lot of

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:41.200
challenges, but I think people can pull those off. They're definitely all better than being in traffic.

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:45.360
So yeah, this is one example. So one thing might have been about commuting, but for the model that

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.140
we've been using for process, the other thing was basically, we took into account the efficiency of

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:53.360
the building that you're actually in. And in the UK, and across Europe, there is like a directive,

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:58.360
which basically mandates that every single building has to have a kind of energy certificate,

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:03.080
kind of bit like how fridges might have energy ratings on them. So you have graded grades for

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:07.620
most buildings. And in the UK, if you know the kind of zip code or postcode for that building,

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:12.560
you can work out the emission, you can get a figure straight away for the kind of emissions per square

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:16.540
metre. So if you know that most employees have like 10 square metres of space over a year,

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:20.400
then you can quickly work out this stuff. And if someone's working on a year, you can compare that to,

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:25.180
say, the emissions from running service, or using this much electricity, or the emissions from

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:29.000
sending things over the wire, you can get an idea of where the impacts might actually be.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.780
So this is why I talk about process. And I'm just speaking specifically on the project level,

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:38.380
because there's, we can work a bit more widely as well, and think about the other things that

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:44.320
we actually do. But I'm mindful that it would take a more than the single podcast to talk about some of

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.040
the wider things.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:50.420
Yeah, absolutely. So one final thing I do want to talk about is offsetting air travel. Now,

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:55.060
flying is not good. But if you do have to fly, we already talked about having a carbon values,

01:02:55.060 --> 01:03:00.440
but it's really a good idea, I think, to at least offset it with something you can do. There's

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.960
places that allow you to do that. It's not perfect, but it's better than doing nothing, right?

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.480
Yeah.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.360
No, I agree. I agree with you, yeah.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.400
Yeah, but obviously, like, less travel is clearly, clearly better. But I did want to point out that

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:14.780
there are places that you can go that are pretty good. You talked about Atmosphere.de?

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.380
Yeah. So this is a German company that only use one of the, and use what are called the kind of

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:25.820
gold certificates for offsets, which are generally considered to be offsets which do not have

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:32.160
unintended harmful consequences. And where they, the projects that are on this are related to at least,

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:38.300
I think it's three, maybe four of the sustainable development goals. These are kind of one of 17

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:42.000
goals, which are generally considered, these are the things we need to be focusing on to make the

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000
world a better place. So that's what these are. Actually, the person I spoke to on a market,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.620
they, the guy, Asim Hussain, who is doing, he was just doing a talk today at DevRelCon about the

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:56.120
different kinds of offsets and what things you have available and what decisions you need to actually

01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:00.440
make for that. And yeah, there's one, there's one in the atmosphere as one example. There's the one

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:05.240
in America called Terra Pass. But generally, if you don't have much time and you cannot avoid travel,

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:11.420
it's safer to just go with something like the gold standards. And I've linked to a gentleman who I,

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:16.240
I kind of have a lot of time for a lot of respect for Kenneth Bowles. He is a, he's a consultant and

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.060
he does need to travel sometimes. And he's basically said, look, this is my air travel policy. He's got

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:23.220
a personal travel policy, not like company, you know, companies might have sustainability policies.

01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:27.360
This is policy on air travel. He says, look, this is what we're going to do. And if I have to travel,

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:31.340
then these are the things I, you need to take into account if you want me to be joining you for

01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:35.080
something. And I feel that there are lots of people who could also do the same thing. And like,

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.980
you could literally just copy and paste this.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:42.480
I'm sure he would be happy and not frustrated if you also adopted his policy verbatim, right?

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.000
Basically.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.100
Yeah. I mean,

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:48.860
one of the things he does is say, I'm going to expense the offset if I have to fly to you,

01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:52.400
which is totally reasonable. He says, if I have to travel internationally, it might be a hundred

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:57.060
dollars offset, but that's part of the bill. If you invite me to come because I'm not traveling

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:57.600
without them.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:01.120
Well, this actually speaks to something which is more interesting. I'm seeing some agencies,

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.200
some forward looking agencies do now where they basically have, they have carbon budgets on projects

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:10.100
now, because if basically depending on where around the world and the UK does have quite good data on

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:15.060
this, you can have, you can basically work out the rough emissions from say, I know a hundred K of

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:19.580
spend or something like that. So if you have maybe a project where there's going to be,

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:24.220
well, which would cost like 200 K, then it's not a huge leap to say, well, this is, if we know that

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:28.700
there's going to be a hundred kilos of carbon emitted per thousand pounds spent, and this is

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:33.360
a 20 K project to 200 K project, then that might leave us with a budget of if we want to be better

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:37.800
than average and we need to be better than average or improving on what's happening each year to kind

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:41.840
of stand a chance of meeting the scary goals. We spoke at the beginning of the year, they say,

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:45.980
well, we're going to have a carbon budget of 20 tons. So everything we do has to stay inside

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:51.040
that budget. And this is a shared responsibility for us and also the client that we're working with.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:55.200
So I think there are some ways, yeah, because this stuff can be quantified. And once you have

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.740
some numbers like that, in the same way that you have performance budgets for websites, I think you

01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:05.620
can use budgets like this to help, you can essentially create the incentives to make it easier to have,

01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:11.000
say a remote call versus having to fly or having to travel somewhere. And I think that without this

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.140
stuff, it's going to be very difficult for us to basically face the challenges that are raised,

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:21.240
that the science dictates. But we do have the tools and the numbers to actually do this. And I

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:26.820
think many of us like the tech industry is such a rich industry compared to others. And there are so

01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:31.520
many people with so much professional mobility who are able to basically say, look, this is how we're

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:36.800
going to work because this is how we chose to come into the industry for this. I think there's a lot to

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:41.720
there's a lot to be said for thinking about this and considering it part of just being a kind of

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:45.320
responsible professional in tech, not in technology to think about these things.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:49.080
Yeah, well said. One final thought I want to throw out there around this travel stuff. I

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:54.280
try to travel less to conferences. I'm going to PyCon this year as I did last year because it's

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:58.880
important and I have to fly to, right? I went to one other conference this year that I had to fly to,

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:05.560
which is Microsoft Ignite in Florida. It was an interesting opportunity that I had. It was worth it. So I

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:09.260
bought offsets for this and that's all fine and good. That's just what I did and still not my favorite,

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:14.760
but whatever. So one thing I would like to see though, is that have conferences make it almost

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:19.820
the default to have not just me do that. The reason I mentioned that conference in Florida by name is

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:23.400
they had 30,000 attendees. How many of those people do you think offset their carbon?

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:27.560
So this is actually really, no, you're absolutely right. And I think this is, there's two things which

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:32.660
I could share with you, which I think might be interesting for you. So I did some work. I helped

01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:37.880
organize a conference called Map Camp, where we basically had a climate sponsor specifically to account for

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:42.040
the fact that we knew that some people were, you know, we made the decision to run a conference

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:47.700
and cause people to be flying here and we chose the venue. So therefore we felt like it's on us to be

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:53.560
accounting for this stuff. And if you kind of just shift it onto the end user, that kind of is a bit

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:58.280
unfair in many cases because you're often already making people to pay for something. And if you budget

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:04.080
for this as part of just how you work, then it's, it makes a lot more sense. And, there are more

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:08.080
group organizations doing this. But the thing that we've done is we actually hired some consultants

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:12.640
to help us work out the emissions associated with that conference. And we also were in the process

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.420
of releasing a report, which has all this stuff where we've got the numbers for this. And we could

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:21.060
see what the trade-offs were so that other people can take this information. And, there's also a

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:25.400
really, really cool Django project called Open Footprint, which is exactly related to this kind of stuff.

01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:30.540
There's a guy called, Sylvan. Oh, I totally forgot his surname. He's on Twitter as Sylvanus,

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:35.140
but he's been building, him and his team. they've been building Open Footprint, which is a

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:40.000
conference carbon footprint calculation tool to allow you to see what the impact of these things would

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.520
actually be. And, for a 600 person conference, it was about, I think we spent, we raised 5k for that.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:50.200
So some of it was education. Some of it was kind of offsetting is what we used, we used for this,

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:55.160
but I think it should be a norm if we're going to be responsible people organizing these events.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:59.380
Sure. Absolutely. And it would be ideal if the people putting on the conference did it. I can

01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:03.180
imagine there's sometimes like smaller conferences or something. They just feel like they're barely

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:08.180
able to even fund this thing and whatnot. So if they can't do that, you know, maybe they could have a

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:14.160
little checkbox on the registry. It's $230 to join this conference. And it has a little pre-check,

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:19.360
maybe even pre-check it carbon offset, $30 I'm flying or something like that. And you can uncheck it,

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:23.100
but if it's pre-checked and you just hit go, you know, how many people would just expense that back to

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:26.740
their company, right? It seems like such a small thing that would make a huge difference. If you

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:29.980
have to say 30,000 people go into your conference, all of a sudden that's tremendous.

01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:34.240
So RussConf does something really interesting in this field. So RussConf EU, they had an event in

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:39.820
Barcelona and because Europe has pretty good trail rail links, they basically said, okay,

01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:44.320
we're running this conference. If you want to get here by train and we'd really, really support you

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:48.280
doing that if you can, there's an interrail pass. And here's a way that you can get here by train.

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:53.500
And it's a different way of traveling because interrail is basically, it's a bit like you pay

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:59.100
for a set amount to be able to take any train or almost any train over a set period of like a week

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:03.740
or so or a month. And I did the same thing as an experiment in like low carbon developer relations

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:09.760
by having a two month interrail pass to travel around all little bits of Western Europe. And they

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:14.280
said, here's how to do this. These are the places you might want to drop a visit along the way as part of

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:20.100
this process. So there are groups who do do this and they think of it, they think of the travel as

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:25.280
part of the conference itself. And I've had people talking about like having a sprint bus where people

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.120
kind of work and code on something together. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. Like there's loads of ideas.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:33.540
We just need to be more creative about this if we're going to have events where people physically

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:38.140
need to be around. And that's totally okay. As long as we think about the full cost of this stuff.

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:42.260
Right. Well, I already told you I'd lived in Germany for a year and I'm very jealous of the

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:47.100
rail system you all have over there. So yeah, let's leave it at that. But yeah, I think even things like

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:51.800
conferences, tech conferences could do a lot, even just little default, just check boxes like,

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:55.860
hey, we're going to donate. You're paying 30 bucks to send some money here unless you uncheck this when

01:10:55.860 --> 01:11:00.760
you register or whatever. Right. Give some people some levers, but make it at least the default option

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:03.680
to not make it so impactful in a negative sense.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.900
There's a group who are working on, and I'm part of it as a group working on a kind of climate code

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:13.860
of conduct for conferences to address these kinds of issues. And I really like if people do have an

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:16.960
interest, it'd be really nice to hear from them because there's a bunch of us. There's a group

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:21.980
called climateaction.tech, which I invest a bunch of time working on because I find it useful for,

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:25.320
which is basically full of other professionals who are trying to do this. And there's a bunch of us

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:28.560
trying to figure out how to do events greener. So if any of this is interesting to you,

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.560
I'd really recommend a joining the community that we have. And yeah, let's talk about some of this

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.740
because it's easier to face this stuff as a group and to compare notes together.

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:41.420
Yeah, absolutely. All right. Well, we are over time on this topic, but it was well worth it. It

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:45.140
was a fun conversation, Chris. Now, before you get out of here, let me ask you the final two questions.

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:48.460
If you're going to write some Python code, try to make it fast and energy efficient,

01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:49.740
what editor would you use?

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:53.800
Oh, I've gone through a number of editors. I started initially with TextMate ages ago,

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:58.360
and then I started using Sublime. And then I kind of started using Vim because I thought that's

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:01.060
what cool people should be using. I'm not a proper programmer if I use Vim.

01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:05.540
And I tried using Emacs, didn't get much luck. And I quite liked Vim. I found myself,

01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:10.660
because I do a number of other things rather than just coding, I really am enjoying VS Code. And I'm

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:16.760
finding the, yeah, VS Code is my editor now. It's free. It's quite, it's well designed and-

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.440
Super flexible. All the extensions.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:24.340
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I'm a big fan of VS Code. It helps me. It saves me from myself in many cases.

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:29.860
Sweet. All right. And then a notable PyPI package that you maybe found interesting or

01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:31.040
is relevant to the conversation?

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:37.140
I'd probably say, I think the energy usage one for the AI thing, I think is really interesting. But

01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:42.860
otherwise, I think I would really point people to OpenFootprint, the open source carbon calculator,

01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:48.600
because we are so good at calculating, you know, we pride ourselves on being informed by data and

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:54.100
being able to quantify things. And I think that if we take that kind of approach to other domains and

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:58.800
domains like this, it will help us make informed decisions about the things we do as responsible

01:12:58.800 --> 01:12:59.580
tech professionals.

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:03.480
Right on. All right. Final call to action. People are interested in doing more,

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.680
giving them some concrete steps. What do you say?

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:10.120
I think it's important to stress that it's okay to, if you don't know what to do right now.

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:15.280
But I think it's also on you as a professional to invest in developing these skills that we will

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:21.320
need to face when we think about like the science and what, and what basically like children are

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:25.500
saying every Friday, because they're scared and they're expecting adults to kind of step up and

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:29.620
do something about it. And I think it's important to learn to invest in thinking systemically.

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:33.280
And this information is out there and there are books and resources out there. I mean,

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:38.000
I think that's the key thing that I would call people to do is be prepared to invest in skills

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.360
that are maybe outside of your kind of traditional domain of technology and learn to think a bit

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.120
systemically. And the thing I would say is that there are lots of other people doing this too.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:51.200
You're not alone. In the group that I help run, climateaction.tech, it's basically full of other

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:55.800
techies who are trying to figure this stuff out and how to do this. And a bunch of the messages and

01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:00.200
the links I've shared, I found through really enriching, useful conversations with people who are saying,

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:03.980
what should I do about the fact that I cannot avoid the flying thing? In fact,

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:08.220
the thing with Kenneth, I remember the conversation that directly informed that and the conversations

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:11.520
with say Microsoft saying, okay, here's how we're going to do low carbon developer relations.

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:15.800
I remember seeing the conversation there and the conversation about say, how do we take in,

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:21.160
do something about the fact that, you know, AI and the use of machine learning is this massive growth

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:26.160
in there. What can we do there? Or in say the UK with kind of the government taking a real,

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:30.840
real kind of ownership on the emissions from their infrastructure. I remember the conversation

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:33.800
there saying, yeah, we should be doing this. There are people out there trying to solve this

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:39.420
and it's okay to feel a bit overwhelmed as long as there are, but it's worth remembering there are

01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:44.200
other people around to solve this and it's easier to solve this when there are other people and to share

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:48.300
this across organizational boundaries. So yeah, those are the two things. Be prepared to invest and

01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:49.380
yeah, join the community.

01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:53.600
Super. And we can do it. It runs on electricity. We don't have to change everything. We just can just

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:56.980
change a few things and it'll be, we'll be good, but we got to do it right. Thank you,

01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:59.740
Chris, for coming on the show and sharing all this. It was super interesting.

01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:02.480
Okay. Thank you again, Michael. And have a lovely round.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.160
