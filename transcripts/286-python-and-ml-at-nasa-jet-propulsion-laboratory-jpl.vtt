00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:07.660
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, JPL's primary function, is the construction and operation of planetary robotic spacecraft,

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.980
though it also conducts Earth orbits and astronomy missions, and it's responsible for operating NASA's Deep Space Network.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.380
On this episode, you'll meet Chris Matman.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.800
He's the Division Manager for Artificial Intelligence, Analytics, and Innovation at NASA's JPL,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.520
and he's JPL's first principal scientist in the area of data science.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.220
We cover a wide range of topics and dive into how Python and open source are growing in the space exploration field,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.820
and he answers the question of whether he thinks we'll have Python running on robots and rovers in space.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.420

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.980
Chris, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.800
Hey, Michael.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.640
Thanks for having me.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.240
It's great to be here, and hi to your listeners.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.600
Well, I almost don't know where to start.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:40.360
There's so many things that you have done in Python in the open source space that I think is going to be really fun to talk about.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:52.240
But I think let's focus mostly on space and JPL and that, and then we'll get to what I think will be a surprisingly large and impressive list of interesting things that you've done.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.540
And so we'll start our conversation there.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.940
But before we get actually into that, let's just start with how you got into programming in Python.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.540
Yeah.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.040
Well, it's a long story.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.900
So I came from the Java world, rewind the clock maybe, I don't know, 15 or 20 years ago.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.860
And I grew up in a trailer in Santa Clarita.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.380
It's about an hour north of LA.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.100
And let's see, my childhood wasn't super interesting.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.680
But anyways, I became a teenager.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.560
I like to tell people, I think I had my first longer than five-minute conversation with my father when I was a teenager.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.360
When my brother, who was out hanging out with the ladies and being an extrovert, I was an introvert,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.240
he asked me to read the paper with him, the local paper.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.960
And so that was nice.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.980
I think I had longer than a five-minute conversation with him at that point.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.220
And so yeah, so I went from there.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.340
I played sports in high school.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.600
I went to Saugus High.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.300
I was 5'9 up until my sophomore year.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.320
And staying that height throughout, everyone else got taller.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.540
So they got to play football.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.360
I didn't.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.540
So I had to do something else.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.340
I had a 4.6 GPA.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.380
The only reason I didn't have a 5.0 on a four scale was they didn't have honors football.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.300
So I decided to go into computers at the time.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.780
And so I went to USC.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.760
I couldn't afford it.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.240
I'm still paying it off right now.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.520
And when I was there at USC, I was sitting in the computer lab one night.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.800
And it was my sophomore year.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.300
And I needed money and a job.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.460
It was like midnight.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.500
And an email came through from a place called JPL.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.440
Not JBL.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.320
The headphone place.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.220
JPL.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.880
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:26.200
And a real nice gentleman, Dr. Rob Raskin, was looking for us computer people to help Earth scientists understand earthquake data and other things.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.380
And so I went for an interview.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.440
I'd never been for one before.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.040
I'd interned at a company called iWin.com.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.240
That was my only other experience basically building video games and Java.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.820
Java applets for the 35 to 55-year-old demographic of people.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.440
It was like online poker games during that era.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.340
So, I mean, that was nice.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.000
That was on the West Side.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.020
You know, of LA.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.740
I got to be near the Miracle Mile.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.160
I learned where UCLA was.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.300
As a USC person, you really need to learn that.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.000
So you can really feel the rivalry.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.800
But it was a beautiful area over there by Mid-Wilshire.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.680
But anyways, JPL was a nice change.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.780
It was closer to USC and where I lived at the time.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.360
JPL is about maybe a 15-20 minute drive into northeast LA from downtown in USC.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.740
And so, yeah, I got a gig at JPL.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.780
And I was like a computer programmer.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.080
I was doing Pearl, PHP, you know, other stuff.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.520
Building websites and databases and MySQL for Earth scientists.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:27.060
And so I did that for maybe, I want to say, as an academic part-time and eventually as an employee for three or four years.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.720
And then I got sucked into the real hardcore Java community.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.520
I was working with folks on technology projects for databases.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.380
I even worked for a project.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.360
JPL was doing work with the National Cancer Institute.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.800
We were basically putting together data for cancer detection because a lot of the stuff we did for remote sensing could be applied to that.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.560
And so, yeah, I mean, Java was big at the time.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:57.680
And my trick was trying to figure out how instead of using C and C++ to build science missions, then I eventually started working on those.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.500
I worked on a nurse science mission called Orbiting Carbon Observatory.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.960
And I had to figure out how to use Java.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.640
I wanted to use Java.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.740
I refused to use C++.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.000
Not that I didn't know it.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.400
Right.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.460
But I was like, God, you know, go ahead.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.300
I was going to say, I've gone through these same stages.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.280
Not with Java, but with .NET.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.200
Just like, you know what?

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:23.200
I know I could do this as a C++, but I'm really over just all the pain and the hoops and the page faults and all the stuff that I just don't care about anymore, you know?

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.060
Oh, my God.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.680
Same thing.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.880
I had done nachos for operating systems.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.460
That was the Berkeley, sorry, Stanford little tutorial project on how to do it.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.580
I learned multiprogramming and memory management.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.740
But who the hell wants to do that regularly?

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.100
And so I was like, Java does this for me.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.280
It's being shoved down my throat.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.740
Let me accept and assimilate.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.420
So, yeah.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:52.860
So my gig was my big thing I cut my teeth on and became kind of known at JPL was that I forced us to basically use Java to implement a ground data system for OCO, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory in 2005.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:06:01.240
And so my trick there was, okay, all the prior Earth Science missions, say, took in 10 years, 10 gigabytes of data.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:14.000
And they ran on order in terms of their processing, their daily processing for jobs to produce data, maybe tens of jobs per day to produce that 10 gigabyte record over 10 years.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:21.300
And so OCO was basically, okay, we're going to take you into the realm of 10,000 jobs per day, daily workload.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.640
And then it was going to generate 150 terabytes of data in the first three months.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.260
And so I actually looked at the C++ system that we built before to do this.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.620
And I was like, you know, it was tied to a database.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.720
It was tied to, like, I don't want to say Oracle, but I think it was like, it was tied to Postgres.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.320
It couldn't run without a database running.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.980
All the configuration was in a database.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.100
It was like single processor, everything else.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.060
And I was like, this needs to be completely rewritten.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.260
And at the time, I had hung around at USC to get a master's degree.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:58.500
And I had a really inspirational professor there during my master's, Dr. Nino Medvedevich, who ended up becoming my PhD advisor, who got me into research.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.220
And I hung around for the PhD as well.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.760
And so in my PhD that I was doing at USC, I took a search engines class.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.900
And I got really into this thing called NUTCH.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.860
N-U-T-C-H, right?

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.400
N-U-T-C-H.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:18.820
And it was a creation of a guy named Doug Cutting, who was the guy who created Lucene and eventually things like Hadoop and all that whole ecosystem.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.240
And my professor at the time wanted us to do our final projects in NUTCH.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.820
And so mine was a really simple syndication or RSS parser.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.420
And by the way, for your listeners, I'm going to get to the Python part.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:34.320
I just have to tell you this so you can make fun of me because I started out in big, big, hardcore Java.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.900
So I got into NUTCH.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.780
I built the RSS parser for feeds, for Nudes feeds.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.240
That was my final project in my search engines class.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.080
During my PhD.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.740
And I contributed to NUTCH.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.280
And I got involved in Apache, the Apache Software Foundation, where NUTCH had just moved to.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.200
And I started talking to Doug and all the other developers.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.380
And I became friends with them.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.460
And I became a NUTCH committer.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.300
The funny part was my academic cousin at UC Irvine, because it's all in the academia.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.920
There's like, who's your advisor?

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.900
He's like your dad.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:01.600
Who's your advisor?

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.520
Your grandpa.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.900
You know, you got cousins and uncles on the academic side.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.420
One of my cousins was Justin Ehrenkranz, who was the president of Apache.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.100
And my academic uncle was Roy Fielding, who was the founder of Apache.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.140
And so I had this sort of Apache connection without even...

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.060
As well as REST.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.660
The whole REST idea, yeah.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.720
The REST architecture.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:19.980
Yep.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.080
Roy's famous for that.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.840
So UC Irvine during the mid-90s, which was like the decade before I was doing it, was

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.520
like the place to do software, you know, big software GUI and multi-architecture development

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.120
and architecture and stuff like that.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.320
Dick Taylor ran the group.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.380
And yeah, anyways, he had a bunch of all-stars.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:41.000
He had the guy who invented Argo UML, the guy who invented WebDAV, the guy who invented REST,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.600
the guy who did the component connector architecture status.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.320
So those are my ancestors academically.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.880
So yeah, so I'm doing search engines and whatever.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.560
I've got this connection anyways to Justin and Roy who are telling me, get involved in

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.160
open source.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.300
And I'm like, cool, okay, I could do that.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.240
And so I started contributing to Nudge.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.060
And Nudge eventually became Hadoop.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.260
And so then Hadoop became Spark.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.740
And so I'm in the ecosystem.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.460
I'm playing, you know, I'm contributing.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.140
I got into search engines.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:11.360
That really became a passion because I was building these big data systems at JPL for mission science.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.840
I was like, we need to use all this Java stuff and all this ecosystem and we need to scale

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.760
and do all that.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.160
So the funny part was, here's the Python long-winded answer.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.000
You asked me, how did I get into Python?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.580
In about 2009, after I had led teams, done this myself, built three mission ground systems on Java.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.900
And we proved all the naysayers wrong that said, you can't do it.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.720
You know, it's got to be C++.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.460
We did a ground system on Java.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.080
I got tired of Java.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.900
And Python was getting shoved down my throat then.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:46.500
And that was like, everybody has, at some level in their career, one or two or three eras of their career.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.540
And my second era beyond early programming was really Java.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.800
And so then my third era was Python.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.720
I mean, I started to get involved.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.740
I went away from missions.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.400
I got involved in technology development.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.180
And I started going to government technology development.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.640
And in the early 2010s, 2012, during the Obama administration, there was the Big Data Initiative.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.420
And they funded a bunch of programs, $100 million investments and things in big data.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:15.540
And I was toe-to-toe in some of these programs, standing alongside of them with people like Peter Wang, Travis Oliphant.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.440
And I started to learn.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:26.840
In fact, I even funded them during a program called DARPA Memex to grow what became what was Continuum Analytics at the time, a smaller company out of EnThought, to what became now Anaconda.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.640
And so I started talking.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.160
And then Peter's sitting there telling me, oh, Chris, screw Java.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.580
You know, I was the Java guy, you know, sitting amongst all the Python fields.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.600
I can just hear Peter saying that as well.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:37.820
Yeah.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.580
What are you doing?

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.560
You're messing around here, man.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:40.940
Yeah.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.640
You know, Peter's telling me about Bokeh.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.940
And he's like, oh, you know, Numba and all this.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.080
And I was like, you guys got all.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.020
And you got your own foundation, NumFocus.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.060
Andy Terrell and I became friends.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.560
I got Andy to come talk at ApacheCon, which was great.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.440
They never invited me to PyData or anything.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.020
I don't know, you know, whatever to them.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.040
But yeah, so I got involved in that.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.940
And so I said, I can do this one more time.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.400
I can go deep and learn.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.340
And so really, probably circa 2013, the big thing for me was I created Tika.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.460
We'll talk about that later.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.200
But that was my big thing in Java besides Hadoop and all this.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.520
And so in 2013, 2014, we ported that to Python.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.080
And I did that with a guy named Brian Wilson at JPL.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.880
And that was my, I can go deep and do Python and deliver something of big value to the Python

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.340
community.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.120
And so, yeah, around then, that's how I got involved in Python.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.920
That's how I'm there.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.880
Now, today, I'm doing machine learning and other stuff.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.780
And anyways, I don't want to dominate.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.380
But yes, that's kind of the answer.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.240
Well, two things.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:41.980
First, to get a call from JPL out of the blue in your undergrad or master's degree program

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.820
and say, hey, why don't you just drop in and just do some work on like cutting edge space

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:46.820
just down the street?

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.380
Like that is incredible, right?

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.660
To get such an opportunity.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.680
And I think that's really, that's really neat.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.440
It's a big time opportunity, Michael.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.980
And for me, the thing I like to tell people, I've learned a lot of JPL in my 20 years there.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.380
And a lot of people look at me and go, God, you've been here for 20 years.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.600
I said, yeah, I'm just sort of entering mid-career.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.220
20 years at JPL is mid-career.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.980
Well, I mean, it's like you want to run a mission.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.080
You got to like, that's a 20-year commitment, a 15-year commitment sometimes.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.960
Oh, dude, you're exactly right.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.120
And so you can see at JPL, I tell people this, you can see the people that are going to be

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.120
there for five years.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.560
And you can see some of the people that are going to be there.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.260
And by the way, we like those five-year people too.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.660
We'll get whatever we can.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.520
We can talk about that later out of whoever.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.100
Our mission is space.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.140
And it hit me in 2003, 2004.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.200
The big thing was the Spirit and Opportunity twin rovers.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:31.940
You know what I mean?

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.060
The first three or four years of JPL, it's awesome.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.100
And you're just like, but you're young and you don't know and appreciate space and everything

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:38.400
else.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.740
And so I was like, oh, yeah, maybe I'll go work at a startup after this.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:46.400
And it hit me in the MER rovers, Mars Exploration rovers, Spirit and Opportunity.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.460
And they send them and they land.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.460
And I saw the landing.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.300
I stayed up at night.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.140
I watched NASA TV.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.380
It was just my wife and I at the time in our new house.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.420
We bought our first house.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:00.760
And I had bought my first 55-inch TV that if you compare to the TVs, the thin ones now, it

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.360
was like as big as my living room.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.820
And I'm like, yeah.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.360
It has its own cooling unit.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.680
It's own cooling unit.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.360
Oh, yeah.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.680
And so we're sitting there.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.360
We're watching it.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.940
And then Arnold Schwarzenegger comes out.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.020
He's the governor of California.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.860
And he's shaking hands with my friends, some of my friends who I worked with on some of

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:16.020
this.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.500
And I'm like, I know.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.620
This is amazing.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.900
And everybody.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.360
And then it's like the JPL.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:21.840
Yeah.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.120
You know, when we landed.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.300
Stuff like that.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.740
And so, yeah, that's when I was like, oh, God, I worked there.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.520
That's awesome.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:28.960
Yeah.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.860
And I knew I was going to stay there, you know.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.180
Yeah.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:31.620
Yeah.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:31.780
Yeah.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.220
Really cool.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:37.100

Oh, and one last thing.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.840
They're hiring.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.960
Go to linode.com slash careers to find out more.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.300
Let them know that we sent you.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:38.320
And then number two, you talked about going deep in Python after being in Java.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.420
And I think it's really interesting to learn a language that has all these nuances and patterns

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.020
and it takes a while to master.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:45.960
I think Java does.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.520
And then you come to Python and it's a language that, you know, one of the jokes is, hey, I

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.060
learned Python.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.980
It was a great weekend or something like that.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.000
And yet I've been doing Python for a long time, eight, 10 hours a day.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.200
I'm still learning Python.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:58.760
Right.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:04.220
So I think there's this really interesting distinction between I learned something and I learned it.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:04.640
You know what I mean?

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.920
Like I really built something meaningful in it rather than, yeah, I know how to do loops

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.600
really well now.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.360
Oh my God.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.300
And that's how it starts.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.340
I mean, the loops are okay.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.440
We're going to start with those.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.720
We're going to start with the basic constructs in our mind.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.880
But yes, absolutely.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.100
Like, like I tell people this, you know, only recently do I tell people, you know, you got

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.540
the three levels, beginner, medium and expert.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.940
And I tell people, I say, I only recently became an expert in Python.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.440
It took me a while because to me to become an expert, you need to go deep.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:37.560
And so for me, and people still tell me today, Chris, your Python code looks like Java.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.060
Damn it.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:42.360
It's not PEP, you know, certified or PEPs or whatever the hell the PEP is.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.340
And we're sitting on black on a pre-commit hook for you.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:50.040
Well, you know, I use a lot of camel case still, you know, in naming stuff.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.060
You know, I don't use the underscore, you know, whatever.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.380
I say, shut up.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.440
It works.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.660
And, you know, and to be honest, so here's my trick though.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.080
And maybe you'll agree with me on this, Michael.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.280
This is true in any software development language.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.860
Even though I don't do this anymore, my PhD is in software engineering and software architecture.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.180
I studied software development.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:16.500
And so for me, I tell people, you've succeeded when you cannot just publish something to open source and say, oh, I did it.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.820
And it, but I built it.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.920
I'm still the only guy maintaining it or gal.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:28.940
And you've succeeded when not only you've put it out into open source, but you've convinced somebody else that it's worth their time to build on your library.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:29.320
Yeah.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.440
And to do something with it.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:35.360
And to me, you've only achieved that level of mastery when you've become master of the programming language as well.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:46.780
But also when some of that mastery is also knowing where to bend and break, how to configure, what sensible defaults are, and how to componentize something in a way that not everyone will love.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.800
But, you know, you can get at least a few people to love.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.940
And that's how you succeed.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.300
Yeah, I totally agree.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.720
And so much of, I built this thing the right way.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:01.060
Right way often is somebody's perception of, like, their context and their use case.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:10.960
Like, we built it the right way because we're Google and we have a million requests a second versus we built it the right way because we're a startup and we have 100 users, but we're growing.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.800
Those two things should not look the same, probably.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.760
You know what I mean?

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.380
Absolutely.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:20.820
Best captured in the multidimensionality problem when you talk today about big data and they talk about the five Vs.

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:25.400
And so for a long time, people thought big data just meant volume or velocity.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:25.840
Yeah.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.660
But the reality is, like what you just said, it's a perfect context.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.200
Like, hey, variety matters.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.580
Veracity matters.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.240
Value.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.520
Your value stream matters.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.060
And so that's the only thing.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.020
And at Apache, we used to have these huge debates.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.560
I became on the board of Apache.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.700
I was hung around for a while.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.320
They suckered me into doing it.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.460
And I did it for five years.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.400
And, you know, it was a great experience.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:50.180
But I used to sit there in these, like, discussions with, like, the big data companies who...

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:56.560
Apache is a great place for them independently to kind of have a DMZ, build software together without wearing their company hat,

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:03.480
and to achieve some general framework consensus that doesn't disrupt the value stream for people downstream who want to do stuff commercially.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.560
And I'm very supportive of Apache's mission and what they do.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.920
And a lot of open source foundations.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.720
I became friends with a lot of the founders of that during that time.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:17.220
And so the thing I used to sit, though, is, like, you'd get the LinkedIn people who made Kafka initially and donated it to Apache.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.260
And they'd have their way, like you said, it's like the Google way.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:24.120
It's like, well, this could only be good if you test it on a million computers.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.500
Or we're not going to accept this dude or gal's patch from, you know, this other country.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.420
Because, you know, they tested it on their laptop.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.140
And it doesn't pass our massive scalable test.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.840
But I'm like, yeah, but it adds a feature.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.280
Just do it in a branch.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.120
Isn't that what source card control is for?

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.660
Get the person the value for contributing.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.600
Don't let it sit in a ticket system forever.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.940
Because then people go away.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:51.880
And your real goal is to capture everybody's interest and contribution in the moment that they're interested in.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.920
Either they've got the time and their free time, their company's paying them to do it.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.820
And time is the thing that you learn is really the last precious resource.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.700
And that's it.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.180
Time, we're never going to get that back.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.940
You can get a lot of other things back, but you're not going to get time back.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.620
And that's the key to open source.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.180
Yeah.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:17.080
Jason Fried from the Basecamp 37 Signals crew has a great saying that inspiration is perishable.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:17.620
Right?

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:25.660
Like, if you're currently super excited to add this feature to that thing, but then maybe you work on it, then the PR just sits there and gets ignored.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.880
Like, you're done with that product.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.880
Like, you're now done.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.140
Right?

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:34.500
But you could have really done a lot of interesting stuff if they captured that two-week period or whatever where you were on fire about it.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:34.900
Yeah.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.720
I've got a good story real quick that I'll share with you and your listeners.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.820
It's the Nutch Project.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.000
So Nutch was dead post-Hadoop.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.980
A lot of projects were dead post-Hadoop.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:47.780
And the reason for that was that basically, when Hadoop came, everyone...

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.800
It was a new hotness and everyone wanted to go work on distributed systems.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.560
They were like, oh, this is what Google did, MapReduce, and now it's open source.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.100
Oh, boom.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:54.960
And they all went to that.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.560
And they all left us in Nutch.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.840
And I was one of the people holding the bag after that.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:03.120
And we had in our Jira and our whatever system...

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:03.920
I can't even remember.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.000
I think we were still using ReviewBoard at the time.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.380
But we were using ReviewBoard and Jira.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.060
And we probably had 100 patches.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.340
And we had from people that were just sitting there.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.040
Some had been sitting for two or three years.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.480
And basically, because the interest and the community of committers left that could actually

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.280
merge the patches, they just sat there.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.300
And so we had one gentleman, I won't say his name, but he had been contributing probably

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.600
50 patches and still trying to get something in.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.040
And he was running a web crawler company in the UK.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.000
And finally, I was just like, you know what?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Because we had these standards in Nutch that had been imposed on us by the Dougs and the

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.200
whatever.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.320
Doug's an amazing guy.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.420
And I get it.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:41.560
I get why we're doing it.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.460
But what I did is...

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.440
The guy reached out to me, the guy in the UK, and he's like, are you ever going to merge

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:46.880
my patches?

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.800
Because this is BS.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.340
And you're really making me hate open source.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.500
And so what I did is I said, you know what, guys?

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.440
I know we have all these rules and blah, blah, blah.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.740
But none of you around, none of you are doing anything anymore.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.700
Here's what I'm going to do.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:03.460
And I just merge all of his patches and figure out how to do it and get it in there.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.740
Nutch is still alive today because of that.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.220
Because we got that guy interested.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:12.180
He pulled a couple of other people that he was working with in and is like, oh, God, the

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:12.860
floodgates are open.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.000
We can develop again.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.140
And then I just let them take their...

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.880
I haven't done anything in Nutch in years.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.980
But the project's alive today because of that.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:24.780
And so you've got to capture absolutely as a scarce resource, like you said, motivate.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:29.140
What was that RSA animate video about purpose, motivation?

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.340
And that's such a great way to capture it, too.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.360
It's the same thing.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.280
Absolutely.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:39.380
So these days, you're over at JPL, and you have some really interesting things going on

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:39.580
there.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.880
You're the first principal scientist in the area of data science.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.960
What's the story there?

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.580
So JPL has this thing called the principal designation, which basically is somebody that's normally

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:50.740
been there like 50 years.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.840
And so, you know, I'm just joking.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.000
No one kill me for that, please.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.540
But it's been there for a long time.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.740
And usually our principles are in...

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:00.740
We've got the founder of hyperspectral there.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.680
Guy Rob Green.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.500
You could argue he's the founder of the field of hyperspectral science.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.000
We've got people who explore.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.520
You know, we had the guy who used to be the project scientist for the Square Kilometer Array.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:15.420
Huge billion dollar international project of ground-based sensing, looking at the cosmos and

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.580
answering the tough question.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.060
That one has so much interesting stuff in terms of how much data it has.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.260
I had some of the folks on from Australia on there to talk about that.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.560
It's kind of my...

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.140
Like, you can't put it in hard drives.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.440
It's so much data type of problem.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.040
So, yeah.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.100
Oh my God.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.600
700 terabits per second.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.480
I used to...

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:36.520
In the 2010 to 2015 timeframe, or 2016 even, that's all anyone ever wanted to hear from me

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.640
is that I had some peripheral involvement in that.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.000
And they're like, talk about that, you know?

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.400
Yeah, yeah.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:44.040
But we've got the guy that was the project scientist founder of that at JPL.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.140
So, I mean, those are our principles usually.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.080
And so, yeah.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:52.980
So, in 2014, they gave me that title because they realized that in data science, a lot of

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:57.060
the stuff, data science was becoming something that basically we were developing a maturity,

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.320
a skill set, and a capability.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:04.180
And JPL actually needed to go triple down and quadruple down on that.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.360
And so, what it means, yeah, is that all the experiences they have, I talked to people

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.320
like your great podcast, Michael, and others.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.220
I'd sit there and talk.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.200
I needed to talk and evangelize to that at JPL.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.420
And so, that was the recognition.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.020
I was an individual contributor still then.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.240
And I basically just would tell people, here's all the stuff with data science.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.380
It's science.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.140
It's math.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.220
It's...

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:28.120
Around that time, I wrote a paper in Nature called A Vision for Data Science, too.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.660
And people like me don't normally get papers in Nature.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:31.960
Yeah.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.020
That was a big deal.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:37.680
And basically, I was thinking a lot about data science and how...

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.260
You'll like this.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.240
I had this sort of dichotomy in education at the time.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:46.340
I'm a PhD computer science software engineering person who, after about a decade at JPL, learned

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:51.860
hyperspectral remote sensing, why Western US water matters, cared about the cosmos and the

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:52.420
SKA.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:57.180
And I even thought at times about getting master's degrees, but kids, mortgages and other things,

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.580
other interests got in the way, which is important.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:05.400
But I was sitting there thinking, how many of me at JPL make it to me, time, being there

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.140
for 10 years?

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:11.300
And any software engineer that we hire five years at JPL before they learn the lingo, and

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.180
it's really hard unless they only live in IT.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:18.920
Or what we were seeing at the time was an emergence of PhD atmospheric scientists or PhD

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.540
computational biologists or whatever who learned Python, believe it or not, could write code,

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.300
understood what logistic regression was, and whatever.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.500
And we had this emerging class of them as data scientists.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.920
They wanted to share their code.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.420
They wanted to work with the software engineers.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:38.720
As opposed to really, and this is going to sound ageist in a way, but it really isn't.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.720
But as opposed to sort of the generation before who didn't want to share their data, they wanted

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.940
nine-month publication moratoriums.

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:49.360
To them, they wanted to file a patent instead of making open source code and things like that.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:54.020
And there's still the evolution of those folks into the new generation today.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.860
But I was looking at that sort of, I'll call supply chain in the education community for

00:24:58.860 --> 00:24:59.420
data science.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.340
And I was asking myself, what's better?

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:07.180
Is it the Python person, highly skilled in deep discipline domain, that their software

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.540
engineering code isn't that great?

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:12.980
But if we pair them with a master's or PhD level software engineer, they could clean that

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:13.260
up.

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.780
And then over time, they'll learn it.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.020
Because like you said, everyone starts out with Python, but it doesn't mean anyone's going

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.080
to contribute to their code.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:19.700
You know?

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:24.540
And so I was actually seeing more on the PhD atmospheric science side of people in Python

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.540
being more useful in data science.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:29.880
And so that's really one of the questions I was asking in that nature paper.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:34.000
And one of the things that I still don't have an answer to today, but we've seen different,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.280
I'd say, momentums.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.800
And it's not just at JPL, in how we source the talent.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.400
And the same is true today with AI, AI engineers and things like that.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:42.800
Yeah.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.980
Well, I think one of the really interesting questions is, do we need more software developers

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.680
or do we need more experts with software development capabilities, right?

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:57.560
You hear the politicians and policymakers go on and on, like, we need to teach coding because

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.720
we have all these coding skill gaps and whatnot.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.960
And I think often at that level, it kind of gets portrayed as, so what we need is more computer

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.900
science graduates, right?

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:15.580
But my theory is what we need is amazing biologists, physicists, doctors, lawyers who can take whatever

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.660
they do and really amplify it with a little bit of code.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:23.380
And I think that's why Python is so powerful is Python is one of these special languages where

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:27.720
you can be effective with a very partial understanding of even what it is or what it does.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:31.600
You don't even have to know how to create a function and you could be useful in Python.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:32.520
A hundred percent.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.460
A hundred percent agree.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.760
That was the conclusion of my nature paper at the time.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.220
And I'm trying to be diplomatic, but let me say something controversial maybe to generate

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:39.560
clicks.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.860
Yeah.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.540
I completely agree with you.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:47.040
And it's heresy in my community where I originally come from, but I don't read transactions on

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.060
software engineering anymore.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:48.560
I'm sorry.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:52.240
I don't only stay in the software engineering community and computer science.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.900
And so for me, I've noticed the same.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:59.540
My direct experience in both building big software projects for big, big national and international

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:04.160
things and sourcing over hundreds of people at JPL and in consulting roles and other things,

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.740
I've come to the same conclusion.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:06.960
I completely agree with you.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.440
Yeah.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:07.740
Yeah.

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.680
And that's not to discount computer science degrees.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:15.760
I think it's, there's a real important role for good software developers with all the

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.400
practices in place there.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.100
But I don't think we need 10 times of those.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:25.520
I think the value would be better if we brought everyone sort of into that camp rather than growing

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.140
that in that isolated camp.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:27.720
So, yeah.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.220
Totally.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:32.340
And you can relate it back to the Twitter hashtag campaign, the learn to code and why it generated

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:36.060
so many, I think, hate on both sides of the political aisle with that.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.380
One of the challenges with that, let's talk about this.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.420
We're going to have a big, there's going to be a big AI skill gap.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:47.120
And people ask me about this all the time related to AI ethics and other things.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.280
So anyways, for your listeners, after all the software development and Java and big data and

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:51.920
whatever stuff.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.840
Now, I'm just a guy that keeps reinventing myself.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.700
I got into AI and ML.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:59.060
Last five years, I've been doing that pretty much a lot.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.300
And so, yeah.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.060
So I'm going to make a bold statement that's been said before.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.260
So I've got air cover.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:08.780
In the next year or two, a million truckers are going to be displaced because really smart

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.720
cars are here and smart trucks are here and they will drive.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.700
And especially the pandemic is accelerating some of these things.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.580
And so as that happens, the learn to code like, oh, we're going to take all the truckers

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.780
and make them software engineers.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:23.660
I think I've developed a happy medium between that and what you and I just said.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:25.000
We're not going to make them software engineers.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.520
Let's glean SME knowledge from them.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.760
They understand the business.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.240
They understand the value stream.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:36.480
Pair them with, say, domain discipline, non-computer scientists, but say people that want to model

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:41.380
the weather aspects of that, the computer vision aspects of that, the supply chain aspects of

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.660
that, that have that plus some Python code.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.380
And I think those truckers still have jobs.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:45.760
Yeah.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:51.840
If you tell the truckers that the Chasm is becoming a Java or hardcore Python developer,

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.860
the Chasm is too big.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:58.100
But if you tell them your job is to sit here, click on this tool, we'll capture your domain

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.020
knowledge and labels, and you're going to interact with really high power.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.260
We could do that.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:02.860
You know?

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:03.300
For sure.

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:09.240
Well, I think also the difference is, do you tell them your past 15 years of experience has

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:15.640
no value, go back to zero and learn programming and then go work for a marketing company versus

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:19.620
we're going to take what you're already really good at, what you actually have a ton of experience

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.120
and are uniquely qualified for.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.880
And we're going to teach you a little code to change.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.060
You're going to build the robots instead of, you know, be replaced by a robot.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.140
That's exactly right.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.140
So that's the win on all sides.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.840
And that's the way it's going to move forward.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.760
And I see some progress on that besides the initial, you know, everyone thinks Twitter is

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:40.340
real life or, you know, everything you read on the news is real life, you know, until you

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.960
live real life and you talk with people.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.740
And so anyways, I've seen the people that are making progress in that area doing what you

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:46.120
just said.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.280
I think that's really great.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:52.060
And just for people who maybe are not aware, like you pulled out this trucker thing, like

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.420
that's a, maybe an odd example.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:30:00.860
Truck driver is the biggest single job category for men in the United States, probably many

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.580
places in the world, but I only know the data for the United States, right?

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:04.940
That's, that's significant.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:05.640
Absolutely.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.500
And it's a big industry.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.720
Actually truck drivers, you know, some people look at this, they learn about, say, you know,

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:14.760
law enforcement or, you know, and this, I mean, especially in the latest news and all

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.500
this, you know, this is a big deal and everything is like, Oh God, I didn't know.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.480
You know, law enforcement made X, Y, Z money, or, you know, they think of it as sort of unskilled

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.560
labor or things like that.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.040
A lot of folks, but they actually are well compensated for what they do.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:30.740
And actually truck drivers, besides being that statistic, like, like you said, I learned something

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:31.460
new every day.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:36.020
One thing I do know related to that is that they are also well remunerated for their services

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:36.860
and things like that.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:41.620
And so the challenge, the other economical challenge is to say, Hey, truck driver, like you said, your

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.820
15 years of skills are gone.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:47.060
And Oh, by the way, the maturity that you developed in those skills to achieve that salary,

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:48.900
you know, and things like that is also gone.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.200
That's a bad lose on all sides.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.520
Yeah, it absolutely is.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.660
But I do think there's more positive fast forward.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.700
So hopefully we can go that path.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.320
This portion of Talk Python to Me is sponsored by Monday.com.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:07.860
Monday.com is an online platform that powers over 100,000 teams daily work.

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:13.740
It's an easy to use, flexible and visual teamwork platform beautifully designed to manage any team,

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.380
organization or online process.

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:20.320
Now, for most of us, we missed our chance to build the first apps ever in the mobile app

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:20.620
stores.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.580
It was a once in a lifetime opportunity.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.020
It was a once in a lifetime opportunity, but it's one that's coming around again.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:30.820
Monday.com is launching their marketplace and running a contest for the best new apps featured

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:31.800
right from the get go.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.320
Want to be one of the first in the Monday.com apps marketplace?

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:36.800
Start building today.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:43.680
They're even giving away $184,000 in prizes, including three Teslas, 10 MacBooks and more.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.820
Build your idea for an app and get in front of hundreds of thousands of users on day one.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:53.200
Start building today by visiting Monday.com slash Python, or just click the link in your podcast

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.140
player's show notes.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:59.560
So let's talk about Python at JPL.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:04.620
I think there's some interesting angles, especially around some of the remote stuff.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.940
A lot of things you guys do work with like rovers.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.400
You talked about spirit.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.380
Just to have a conversation with those things is like it.

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:17.080
We complain about latency, you know, like that website was slow or I was playing this game

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.280
and it was hard because there was 200 milliseconds of latency.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.000
There's different kinds of latency out in space, right?

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.740
When the speed of light is not enough.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:28.620
So taking some of the smarts and putting it on like rovers and other stuff, some of this

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.000
AI work that you're doing, it sounds like it might have some legs.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.140
Hey, I hope so.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.320
And we think it does too.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:38.240
So Michael, basically the work that we're doing for your listeners, we have a project

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.460
that we've been investigating now.

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:40.860
So let's fast forward the clock.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:44.980
So rovers nowadays, the last one that landed on the planet, I won't say that we shipped

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.100
because we just shipped one, which we'll talk about called...

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:47.200
Right.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.840
Just a couple of weeks ago or something, right?

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.500
We did.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.440
Pandemic shipping and launching of rockets and rovers.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.280
It's the new fad.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:33:00.000
But yes, for pre that, pre-pandemic in 2012, we shipped the Mars Science Laboratory or the

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.880
Curiosity rover.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.060
And that one is about...

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:06.180
So Spirit and Opportunity, just the size them for your listeners.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:11.040
It's about the size, like if you have kids of one of those cars that you push, maybe, or

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.700
something like that, or maybe like a power wheel, big wheel type of thing.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.940
That's the size of Spirit and Opportunity.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:21.200
The MSL rover is about the size of a small car, like a Volkswagen bug.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.600
And if you came to JPL and it was open and love to have you someday and things like that,

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.660
you could walk into our building 180 and see a full scale model of it to really get the feel

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:29.880
of it.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.380
But that's the size rover that we're talking about now.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.220
That's sort of the modern class of them.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:37.320
And so 2020 is the Perseverance, the one we just launched.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.380
It's the same size.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.860
So we've got MSL still operating.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.860
Spirit and Opportunity aren't anymore because they were solar powered.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:51.180
MSL is powered basically by nuclear fission, uses an RTG power source and things like that.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.060
So it doesn't have to worry about solar panels.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.400
So it can go for quite a while and has been.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.660
So it's a great test.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.900
Basically, as long as it mechanically is still functioning, right?

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:00.460
Absolutely.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:04.820
And so challenges with mechanical functioning are like, hey, we learned a lot about the

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:10.300
wheels from like a car size thing as we drove over walks and it tore the wheels up, you know,

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:10.660
and things.

00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:11.220
And so we did.

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:12.580
We learned a lot about them.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:17.420
If you look at one quick update in 2020 is that the wheels have little Homer Simpson speed

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:23.100
holes or not speed holes, but holes to prevent having just track and tread that dies by catching

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:23.600
on everything.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.100
And that's just one thing we learned amongst other things.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:27.640
We got smart engineers at JPL.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.680
But MSL is a great platform to test stuff out on.

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.800
However, let's talk about AI and ML.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.140
I'm going to dispel some myths and rumors.

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:39.960
So MSL and space assets and others, they all need, right?

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.040
We got to do computing.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.940
We need a processor and a board and things like that.

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.220
They are running off of an old.

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:46.720
What is it?

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:47.700
The latest GPU?

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:51.020
Probably like a NVIDIA, like 2080.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.200
Something like that.

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:52.360
Yeah.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.680
Everybody thinks that.

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:55.480
And I know you're being facetious.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.120
And that's why I like the snark.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:57.780
It's awesome.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:58.840
But yes, no.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.660
And that's the challenge.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:00.540
Everybody thinks that.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:01.100
And it's not.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:06.480
It's running off of a RAD 750, which is a BAA chip that's about as powerful as a PowerPC

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.020
chip and iPhone 1 processor.

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:09.500
And so, and why?

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.560
Real quick, why?

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:10.920
Right.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:15.080
When we crash something in the government, we've got a congressional inquiry that we

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.000
have to respond to.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.440
And when this commercial companies do it, and we love the commercial companies, we're partnering

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.840
with them now, they don't, right?

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.520
They can, I mean, not to say that it doesn't ruin their value stream or their reputation or

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.300
things like that, but they've got a little bit more flexibility to do testing and stuff

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.060
like that than we do.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.440
And so we are risk averse by profile and definition.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.700
And so because of that, we will only use things that are what we call radiation hardened.

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:38.100
Yeah.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.160
Which means that when it gets up there into space, a space does in cosmic radiation, do

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.220
weird things to your hardware.

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:46.200
They flip the bits amongst, that's like the easy stuff they do.

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.760
They do a lot of other nasty stuff.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.420
And so you got to make sure that the hardware works in space.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:54.960
And so because of that, the technology, the Gartner lifecycle for what we could use, you

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.620
know, for that is real behind.

00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:01.380
And so this big smart, I mean, this big potentially smart, you know, and it is smart.

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:05.520
They did great things on MSL and they're going to do even greater in 2020 is running off

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.300
of an old processor.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:10.020
So all of the AI and ML is human in the loop, even more so.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.160
Coupled with the fact that you alluded to.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.160
Hey, you know, bandwidth, latency, you think that's an issue?

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.240
The light time from Earth to Mars is eight minutes round trip.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:23.360
So anything you send to Mars, you got to wait eight minutes to figure out what the heck happened

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.420
or even what happened for your report back.

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.100
And you know, that's not, it doesn't all have to be synchronous.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.300
There are asynchronous ways.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:33.420
There are ways to kind of achieve some advantages and cue things up, but it's still, it's eight

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:34.420
minutes basically.

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:38.640
And so because of that, there's a great video on YouTube, by the way, for your listeners,

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.080
if you haven't seen it, it's called the seven minutes of terror.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.460
It's really kind of closer to eight.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:42.800
Yeah.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.300
Yeah.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.120
That's a great one.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:44.300
Yeah.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:44.660
Yeah.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.220
That's for the entry, descent and landing.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:51.000
When they landed MSL Curiosity, they had to use a big sky crane instead of the typical

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.660
big balloon, wrap the rover in a balloon and let it bounce, which was the way they did it

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:54.880
before.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.600
It was so big.

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.900
They had to have this elaborate sky crane thing.

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:02.620
And in that seven minutes, when you go into entry, descent and landing, there are seven minutes

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.620
before you knew, Hey, what the heck happened?

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:08.460
And all this stuff had to happen, you know, autonomously and things like that, which is great.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.660
But yeah, normally eight minutes.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:17.220
And so if I told you today that the Mars surface operations people use about 200 images a day

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:21.540
that are taken from the rover from its nav cams, which are cams by the wheels and its mass

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.800
cam, which is the big head that takes selfies, you know, and other things that you see with

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.260
its arm.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:31.400
If I told you that today they only use 200 images to plan what to do for rover operations the

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.420
next day, you'd understand why we're bandwidth limited.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:38.940
We're limited on what we can process on the rover versus sucking them down to the ground and

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.600
making decisions.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.420
What if I told you tomorrow, we'll get close to that Nvidia chip?

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.380
Maybe not exactly.

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:48.340
But there's efforts called high performance spaceflight computing to build a multi core

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.400
GPU like chip that is radiation hardened.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.460
It's a big government project that has an emulator already and that they're making.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:59.860
And that we also today have Mars helicopter on perseverance, which is a little drone that

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:05.420
went along with it that if successful, is running a Qualcomm Snapdragon, which is a GPU like

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:05.680
chip.

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.280
And why are we it's not fully radiation hardened and all this it does.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.760
We've tested in whatever, but it's not like has the years and years of testing.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.100
Why are we doing that?

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:18.680
Because it's a technology demonstration and we have a bigger like the mission is still successful,

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:23.820
even if Mars heli, you know, is not successful with that, which we call ingenuity.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:24.380
Right.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:30.180
And I suspect that the risk to a little drone helicopter thing, the highest risk is not

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:32.620
the hardware getting messed up from radiation.

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.800
It's like it got caught in the wind and it just crashed.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.520
And well, that was nice, but it's upside down.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.260
So there it goes.

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.440
Or there's just so many risks.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.240
It's probably just considered mostly expendable.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.220
Let's try this.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.460
It's small and it'll be cool.

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:43.380
Exactly, dude.

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.700
And all the dads in the world just knew what we were talking about from their drones.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.220
They were given a couple of Christmases ago.

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.860
But yes, like your drone is going to flip upside down.

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:54.240
It's going to do, you know, all the nasty stuff that you don't think about because driving

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:54.800
a drone is hard.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.060
But apparently, you know, JPL is pretty good at all this stuff.

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.600
So we have a really good feeling this will be successful.

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.640
But yes, so those will have GPUs ish and we can do some stuff.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.560
So a couple of things that your listeners and you might care about that we're doing.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:11.980
So we have a task to do killer apps given the new GPU environment for future rovers.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.600
One of them we call Drive-by Science.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.960
We take Google's show and tell TensorFlow image captioning model, which I don't mean to just

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:23.880
jump into tech speak, but basically uses a labeler for object labeling, which is a head

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.140
that we call, you know, it could be ResNet 50.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:30.560
It could be VGG 16, which is given an image, what objects are in it.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.800
And then it uses...

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.440
That's a rock, that's sand, that's a ledge, that kind of stuff, right?

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:35.840
Bingo.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.740
Don't go over the ledge, by the way.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:45.740
That's the second part, which is the language model, which we use an RNN or an LSTM, a recurrent

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:51.020
neural network or a long short-term memory network to basically learn the language surrounding

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:51.620
those labels.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.460
Ah, this rock is close.

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:54.920
Bedrock is far away.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:40:00.780
This planar surface is, you know, there are three objects in this planar surface and things

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:01.040
like that.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.500
And those are all language properties that an LSTM and an RNN, when you hook it to basically

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:09.180
an object detection network or a CNN, a convolutional neural network.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:14.240
Basically, given an image, I can emit a human language sentence about it.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:14.880
Now, what...

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.120
Or a caption about it.

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.560
Now, what's the value of that?

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.560
The value of that is that text is cheap.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.080
It's a lot smaller than images.

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:26.820
And so instead of 200 images today on that very, very, very thin pipe, I can send you

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:30.940
a million captions if I can run the image captioning model on the rover.

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:36.100
If I can run it on a GPU or if I can run it on a heli and things like that drone asset.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.120
So that's drive-by science.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:42.220
That's make the rover not miss science when it's driving and we got to wait, you know,

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:42.900
those eight minutes.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:43.220
Yeah.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:46.600
And so that's very helpful tomorrow for people.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.900
The other is also another image recognition problem.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.180
It's called energy-aware optimal auto navigation.

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:52.960
You know, say that five times fast.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:58.360
But the idea is that when the rover's motor, hey, even though it's RTG and things like that,

00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.660
we still want to be...

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.300
It's got to sleep for a while and recharge, you know, and stuff.

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.220
And so we want to be efficient with its time.

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:08.820
And so when we do that, we want to know if in the distance, we're going to drive over sand

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:10.100
or we're going to drive over rocks.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.480
Because if it's sand, just like your car, it's going to have to expend more energy from

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.260
the motor than it is if it's going to be rocks and the wheels are going to catch better.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:21.380
And so we do image recognition with that using a similar network.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.640
And then we develop a motor power profile from that based on what we're seeing.

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.240
Yeah.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:26.720
So that...

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:26.780
Yeah.

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:30.060
Because if you say, I want to go inspect that canyon, go there.

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:33.040
It would be great if you could get there twice as fast.

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.100
That's exactly right.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.140
And so today we've got car-sized rovers because that's what we got 50 million instruments.

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.840
I don't have 50, but we have 20 instruments or so.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:44.460
It's a big laboratory that we want to do experiments on, you know, and stuff.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:49.860
In the future, with Mars sample return and other profiles and missions, which I'll talk about,

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.500
MSR, that has something called the Fetch Rover.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:58.080
What 2020, the current Perseverance Rover, is going to do as it's drilling cores and analyzing

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:04.960
stuff, it's going to drop tubes on Mars that a future mission, MSR, Mars sample return that

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.920
has the Fetch Rover, which is a much smaller rover that's going to have to drive way, way

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.360
farther if successful.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.700
And now this is a collaboration.

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.700
So it'll go around and pick up these tubes and then return them to us.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:15.220
Bingo.

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:16.460
And it's going to take the tubes.

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:21.460
It's going to take them to a spot, drop the tubes off, launch the tubes up into space to

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:25.680
an asset, and then take that asset back, you know, on the journey back to Earth and get

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.500
us samples from Mars.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:27.880
It's an amazing mission.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:28.280
Yeah.

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.860
We have a lot of the technology we didn't have 10 years ago when they envisioned this.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.140
It will be successful.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.820
And I'm going to go out there on a limb.

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:40.220
And so, but yes, those rovers, those rovers like the Fetch Rover, they need energy aware

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.560
optimal auto navigation.

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.320
They're going to need it.

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:46.800
It's going to be a much smaller rover, possibly RC car, not maybe that small, but maybe like

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.180
a bigger RC car type of thing.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.880
It's going to be, or maybe two of them, it's that size rover.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.440
It can drive much farther.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.300
And so energy where optimal auto navigation is real big.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:58.620
And so is drive by science, even though it's not going to have all the instruments on it,

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:01.420
visual, optical, things like that.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:05.260
All the deep learning models that are built terrestrially today, we can leverage those.

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.660
So that's really cool.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:11.920
The nuclear power versus solar power seems like something that's almost required.

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:18.240
If you're going to burn that much energy running high end GPUs ish, as you put them, right?

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.020
You don't want to burn up all your solar energy for the day, trying to figure out where you

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:22.520
should drive.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.860
Yep, absolutely.

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:25.160
And so they estimate that.

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.040
So the trade on that is going to be how they pack that energy profile in there.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:32.420
But there's a lot of smart, again, with all the advancements that are happening in

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:38.220
the smart car and other industry and things like this for how to do power in an efficient

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:41.400
way and different cell technologies and stuff like that.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:41.780
We're not.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:48.020
That tech is here today, which is good because we're in phase B of that, which is there's

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:52.780
an A, B, C, D, E, E's, you're operating the mission, A's pre-phase A and planning.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:53.900
We're already in B.

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:55.360
We're partnering with the Europeans.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.960
They're now building the rover on MSR.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.280
We're working together.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.060
And so, yeah, we're going to need all that.

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:01.400
Yeah.

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.480
Well, that sounds like a really cool project.

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.680
Do you see Python running on Mars potentially?

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.900
Or would this be like something lower level?

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.360
I think Python could run on Mars.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.920
They told me 10 years ago, Java could never run on Earth to power a ground data system.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.660
And we figured it out.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:16.040
It did.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:16.980
Yeah, it did.

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:18.400
Python will run on Mars.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:23.140
So I guarantee you, so Python today, if we take the emulator stuff that we're doing and

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:27.360
also the stuff we're doing on the Qualcomm Snapdragon, Python is running in those environments

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.840
because we're using TensorFlow Lite.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:33.520
The hardest part is the magic too is like, oh, we got all this deep learning, you know,

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.340
bring it into this embedded processor and then everything breaks, right?

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:40.680
Your model, you got to quantize the weights, you know, like you don't have the same floating

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.220
point units.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.060
Wow.

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:42.640
What a pain.

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:46.120
And you know, Google knows this and they're making a lot of investments to make this easier

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:46.940
with the ecosystem.

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:48.480
So is Facebook and PyTorch.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.120
All the places are NVIDIA.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:56.160
They're figuring out they need to make that ecosystem process a lot easier for deployment

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.880
because everyone's just assumed capacious everything and infinite everything.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:00.700
And that's fine.

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:03.780
That's where the value stream for these products came from.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:07.100
Especially when they come from the cloud where it's just scales up and you know, we'll just

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.400
throw machines at it.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:09.000
That's right.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.480
And so yeah, that's the biggest challenge right now is, but yes, today Python is running

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.760
on HPSC emulator with TensorFlow Lite.

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:16.600
We've got it working.

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.780
We're running these models.

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:22.760
Basically, instead of using ResNet head and stuff like that, we're using like mini versions,

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:27.540
like mini models of that, like tiny ResNet and other things that have quantized, you know,

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:27.700
weights.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:28.640
You trade accuracy.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:32.740
But the real thing that this is driving, and this is a big research area I'm in right

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:37.900
now is what's the least amount of labeled data, how quantized weights and things like that

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:38.680
to still achieve?

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.960
And what are the limits of learning?

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:44.100
What accuracy do you need that you can trade that you can give some up on for that and still

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:45.360
achieve the results you're looking at?

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.620
You'd be surprised at some of the results.

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:51.240
Like you don't need these insane accuracies like you're better than human results.

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:54.600
You just need really good results and things like that.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.820
Yeah, especially with what you're trying to accomplish.

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.160
It doesn't have to be completely accurate.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.280
If it can just do better, it's a win.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:02.100
That's right.

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:07.440
Talk Python to me is partially supported by our training courses.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.420
How does your team keep their Python skills sharp?

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:14.560
How do you make sure new hires get started fast and learn the Pythonic way?

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:20.580
If the answer is a series of boring videos that don't inspire or a subscription service you

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:23.560
pay way too much for and use way too little, listen up.

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.460
At Talk Python Training, we have enterprise tiers for all of our courses.

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:32.020
Get just the one course you need for your team with full reporting and monitoring.

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:36.920
Or ditch that unused subscription for our course bundles, which include all the courses and

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:39.740
you pay about the same price as a subscription once.

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:47.040
For details, visit training. talkpython.fm/business or just email sales at talkpython.fm.

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:54.600
Let me ask you just really quickly about what else you see Python doing in JPL that you think

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:55.560
is interesting you want to share.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.700
And then I'd like to talk just like a couple of the other things that you were involved

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:00.320
in that I think were interesting.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.840
So I think Python has real deep depth in data science at JPL.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:10.240
Jupyter is now, you know, Jupyter notebooks is the lingua franca of the way that we share

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.160
data science with people.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.680
I've got in my division.

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:13.980
So I lead the department now.

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:17.540
So I'm even, they took away all my keys to tech and I'm not supposed to do anything.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:20.780
That's why I do these interviews with you and still do open source so I can do some tech,

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:21.600
you know, and be involved.

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:26.420
But my people that are doing the tech now, again, like when they show me something, they

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.440
show our stakeholders, something, business people, things, they jump into Jupyter.

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:31.780
And that used to be...

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:35.640
It's not like a PowerPoint picture of what they drew and then they could talk about the

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.980
code, but like here is the live thing, right?

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:38.700
They did.

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.540
Here's the live thing and they show it.

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:44.540
You know, we have demonstrations to partners and various industries and things.

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:47.460
We've got the space demonstrations and they're jumping straight into that.

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:51.760
They're showing these amazing visualizations, tabular statistics, and they've got the data

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.200
story.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:56.620
And so one thing I tell all the people is you got to become visual storytellers nowadays.

00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:57.700
You got to be able to communicate.

00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.720
And Jupyter is perfect for that.

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:05.860
Pandas, the whole ecosystem, MapPlotlib even, but also Plotly and how you can embed like Bokeh

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:06.580
and some of these things.

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:10.160
Anyways, all that ecosystem for communicating data science is big.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:14.600
And then there's such connection between Python to the cloud community and whatever too.

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:18.480
The funny joke back in the Peter Wang and Travis and I days and Andy Terrell was,

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:22.740
you still need us Java people because all your Python does are their thing clients to

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:23.540
our Java server.

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:23.940
Yeah.

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.440
That's not totally true today.

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.620
It hasn't been sort of fully supplanted.

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:32.420
I would say there are still some cases where that's still true, but Python has come a long

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:35.500
way in its ability to support big processing natively in Python.

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:41.380
And especially if you're doing deep learning, but even for more practical workloads and non-GPU

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:43.160
workloads and stuff, Python's come a long way.

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:48.660
And so there's still very, very deep, I would say, infection of Python into JPL, not just in

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:52.700
the specialized domains and disciplines, engineering and science, but we see it in IT.

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:54.380
That's where I live now in IT.

00:48:54.540 --> 00:49:00.220
I used to be the deputy CTO, but now I'm division manager for AI and I report to the CIO and manage

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:00.720
these people.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.680
But it's now infected Python into business.

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:07.140
It's infected into even some of our programmatic directorates.

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:12.500
Like you said, you got the managers, the solar system exploration managers that will jump into

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.580
a Jupyter notebook to show you something.

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:14.860
Right.

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:19.500
And so that's really told me that it's become really material.

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:22.920
You know, and again, we're not having the Python as good battles anymore.

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:27.080
And that's why I also believe Python will make it onto the rovers and into space, because at

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:31.620
that level, if it's sort of infected into that domain, all areas of your business, it really

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:32.100
is there.

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:33.480
And so I'm sorry, Java community.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.060
I love you.

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:39.820
I still do stuff with Tika every now and then, but it's been a while, but I do Python now.

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:46.540
You know, I had this really weird experience long ago when I learned Python and I'd come

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:51.720
from C Sharp, which is C++ and then C Sharp and then Python with JavaScript sprinkled in.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:56.760
And I think C Sharp is a pretty good equivalent to Java in terms of like how the language looks

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:57.260
and works.

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.640
Thought starting a battle between those two things, right?

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:03.580
But I think like just compared to Python, like those are sort of coming from the same space.

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:08.100
When I went to Python, it was really weird to me that white space mattered, that there wasn't

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:09.300
like a curly brace type thing.

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.500
Like I didn't miss the semicolon.

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:11.220
That was fine.

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:14.800
Like an if statement didn't have parentheses around the condition.

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.000
Like, gosh, that is weird.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:24.680
That is like almost every language I've worked with from scheme to C++ to C to they all, they

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:28.080
just, to me, that's what language meant, you know?

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:32.980
And like, it was my paradigm was this must be part of the programming languages, all these

00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:37.500
sort of structural symbols, because everyone I worked with that was a real language was like

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:37.720
that.

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:41.940
And so I came to Python and it took a week or so to get comfortable.

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.080
And then I was like, I'm kind of okay with this now.

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:44.460
It's fine.

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:45.880
Like the editors are super smart.

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:48.340
So they kind of like build the structure for me anyway.

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:49.180
I hit colon and enter.

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:49.820
It'll auto indent.

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:50.380
This is great.

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:54.200
And then I went back and I thought it would be fine to work on some project that I'm still

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:54.680
working on.

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.260
And I'm like, why are these symbols here?

00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.720
I used to think they had to be here.

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.200
Now I'm typing all this junk.

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.780
And literally, it's not necessary.

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.280
Like, it's literally not necessary.

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.380
Why am I doing this?

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:04.600
Right?

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.940
Like you could have the if statements without the parentheses just as well.

00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.500
There's just so many things.

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:13.460
And I really like you talk about like, I don't do that much Java anymore.

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:16.940
And there's just like this comfortableness to work in this space.

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.580
It was unexpected to me, I guess.

00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:19.860
100% same thing.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:23.640
And the real evangelist for me, I want to give credit to him, was a guy named Sean Kelly,

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:25.680
who was a member of the Plone Foundation board.

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:29.740
And Sean actually has been a contractor engineer for us at JPL for a long time.

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:33.240
For your listeners, JPL had Larry Wall, the inventor of Pearl.

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.840
Actually, he was in my old section.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.960
And when I was there at the time, but I was young and I didn't know him.

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:38.960
So for those of you.

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:43.380
But we had Sean Kelly, who was one of the founders of Plone, which largely, I'd say,

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:46.020
Plone is still developed, but other CMSs have come.

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:47.600
But Plone was like the thing.

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:48.980
It became a foundation for a while.

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:52.840
And Sean was heavily involved in Python and PSF and stuff like that.

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.860
And so his thing for me was, Chris, you got to get on this.

00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:58.920
He had been telling me for years, you got to get on the Python drug and the same thing.

00:51:58.920 --> 00:51:59.700
So I get on it.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:02.580
And he's like, you won't miss all the stuff you just said, Michael.

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:04.000
You don't miss somebody calling you out.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.660
So then I'm still co-developing a lot in Java and Python at the beginning.

00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:09.040
And I'm going back and forth.

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.780
And I'm just like, oh my god, it is so bloated.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.120
I can't stand this anymore.

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:17.520
Like, oh, you know, this is a waste for stupid curly braces.

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.100
And this is just a waste.

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:24.580
And then also, one thing that Python does is it almost makes you think more executive-like

00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:25.720
in a way I think about that.

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.200
It's bullets.

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.340
The reason that tabs are there is it's like bullets.

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.460
It's indent this.

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:32.300
It organizes your thoughts in just a more natural way.

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:38.860
Whereas the structure in Java and other more verbose languages is imposed through you having

00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:39.780
to sort of renumerate it.

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:40.900
But this is life.

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:44.620
I mean, over the years, what we have in an IDE now didn't exist before.

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:47.820
And actually, the way I learned to program, and maybe you, and I still think this is a

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:50.580
valuable skill, is I still go into VI, instrument the code.

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:54.360
I don't even use debuggers because they really sucked back in the day when I learned.

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:58.360
I mean, GDB was there and other things, but the debuggers weren't that great.

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.300
And so I still, guess what, people?

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:04.440
Instrumentation in any language and printing stuff out and values of your variables works

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.800
independent of any debugger.

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:10.080
And so people look at me nowadays, too, and they're just like, oh, God, you still do that?

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:10.460
I'm like, yeah.

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:11.220
And it works.

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:12.720
And I still managed to be hyper-efficient.

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:17.700
So some of these basic constructs, but again, the tooling, the IDEs, and all of that, they

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:18.780
eventually supplanted.

00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:21.000
I think Python is a natural evolution of language.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.240
Everyone tells me Julia is the next thing.

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:27.160
Actually, my PL people at JPL, my programming language wonks, who are just amazing.

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:29.260
Some of the best people in the world are like, oh, Julia, Julia, Julia.

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:30.620
And I'm like, it's great.

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:32.660
It came out of the DARPA X data program.

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:33.620
I was a part of that.

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:35.420
I know all the people at MIT that made it.

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:36.280
It's fantastic.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:37.180
It's growing.

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:38.100
It is not Python.

00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:41.960
Python has now become, it's not just scientific cool, it's enterprise.

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:45.680
And Python is that, I really think it's supplanted Java in many ways.

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:49.420
And Julia may be the next thing, but by then, I don't plan to be programming.

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:50.080
Sorry.

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:52.020
You know, I-

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:53.800
Maybe sitting on a beach somewhere, huh?

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.880
Sitting on a beach.

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:55.640
That's the goal.

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:56.320
Perfect.

00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:57.260
All right.

00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:58.680
Two other things I want to talk about.

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:02.900
We're getting short on time here, but just really quickly tell us about a couple of years

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:07.380
ago, I read this book called The Panama Papers, and it was rocking the world.

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:12.740
There are so many people who had been doing shady things through offshore companies and

00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:13.040
whatnot.

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:19.160
And there was, I guess, someone on the inside that dumped gigs and gigs of data that exposed

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.360
a bunch of folks.

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:23.860
I don't remember the details well enough to go into them, but it was a big deal.

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:29.380
And some of your projects were involved in sort of the discovery of that, right?

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:30.320
Tell us about that.

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:30.860
Yes.

00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:31.820
So the key was Tika.

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:34.140
And that was a really interesting time.

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:39.140
We were right in the middle of the DARPA Memex program, which was to build the next generation

00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:39.520
of search.

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:42.180
And by then, I was mostly exclusively in technology development.

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.040
It was pre-IT.

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.560
I hadn't moved into IT yet.

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:48.840
And I was finishing out my career, really, in engineering and science and leading a team

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.840
of real rock stars, the best in the world.

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:55.180
Some of them who are building and have built Siri out at Apple in their future things right

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:55.340
now.

00:54:55.420 --> 00:55:00.040
Some of them who have been bought by Apple for huge company values, talent buys, people

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:02.100
really that just went in and changed the world in search.

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:05.700
Every time I worked with these DARPA programs, which is why I love DARPA so much, and NASA

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:06.700
and DARPA work well together.

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:11.260
I look around the room and I'm like, oh God, I just fanboy geek out on all the people that

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:11.560
are there.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:14.480
Yeah, I've worked on some DARPA project as well and have the same feeling.

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:15.840
Yeah, that's so awesome.

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.680
And so we should talk about that offline.

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:22.120
But so yeah, so I'm sitting there on Memex and Memex, my big goal was to build out Tika,

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:23.900
to evolve Tika for the next generation.

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:30.780
Not like full AI today, although we're in the process of really AI-ing Tika and its constructs.

00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:36.960
But it was like the first step into AI beyond just statistical information retrieval, which

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:37.620
Tika does.

00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:38.300
So what is Tika?

00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:39.540
It's the digital babble fish.

00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:43.540
The way I describe it is Tika is just like the babble fish from the Hitchhiker's Guide

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.040
to the Galaxy.

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.320
You put it to your ear and you can understand any language.

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:50.160
Tika, you give it any type of file format, any type of file that exists on the internet

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.860
that we know, 1400 plus file types and more.

00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:57.700
Tika will extract out the text, extract out metadata from the file, and it'll tell you

00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:00.860
information about the language of the file, which is basically everything you need to do

00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:02.320
something with the data in the file.

00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:07.140
And it incorporates all of the major third-party parsing libraries that are free and open source

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:08.520
to get that information out.

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:11.280
And it uses all the standard metadata models and this and that.

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:16.920
And so what we were doing during Memex is we were evolving Tika to support the non-standard

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:19.480
types of content, the easy text and the other things.

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:23.500
But when you get an image, instead of just getting metadata out, get out who's in there.

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:28.000
Do object recognition and tell me the people, places, things, dates, times, and other things

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000
that are in those images, videos, and multimedia formats.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:31.960
That was the goal of Memex.

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:34.260
And so we were significantly building out Tika at the time.

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:36.920
There was so much action going on on Tika in the open source community.

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:40.280
Well, we had this guy, Matthew Karuna-Gaziglia, show up.

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:42.060
And I'm like, oh, you know, who's this guy?

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.480
And he had built NodeTika.

00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:47.740
We had a bunch of people building Tika interfaces into other programming languages.

00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:48.540
And so he did that.

00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:49.260
He contributed it.

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:50.180
And we start talking to him.

00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:54.880
And he starts asking us these questions and telling us he's part of the ICI4J, or International

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.640
Consortium of Journalists.

00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:57.400
And we're like, cool.

00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:58.220
We start looking it up.

00:56:58.220 --> 00:56:59.920
And then, boom, Panama Papers drops.

00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:02.660
And we're like, holy SH.

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:04.860
They used Tika?

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:08.080
That's why that guy was asking us all these questions, you know?

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.500
And all this.

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:14.980
And so what they did is, yeah, they got this data dump leaked from a company called Monseca,

00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:20.360
which basically said, yeah, like the heads of state in various countries and famous actors,

00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:24.440
your favorite ones, like mine, Hermione and Emma Watson, they all had money, you know,

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.900
in shady ways in these offshore accounts, and they hid their wealth there, you know?

00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:30.320
And of course, that has all sorts of ethical and other implications.

00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:34.940
So that was in these data files, which were leaked off of a content management site, 11

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:36.080
terabytes of data.

00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:40.180
And the way that you did that is you do a big ETL, extract, transfer, and load process,

00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:42.260
and do data forensics using tools like Tika.

00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:43.840
And literally...

00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:44.160
Right, right.

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:47.740
Tell me the important stuff about these gigs of files, and then we'll go through that.

00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:48.300
Bingo.

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:50.980
What are the people, places, things, connections, and other things?

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:54.820
And if you look at the Wikipedia page, which was like one of the fastest Wikipedia pages

00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:58.640
I've ever seen made, when that story came out, it's like it had all...

00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.260
It was like the hugest Wikipedia page.

00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:05.120
About midway down through, and I got a link to my page on Wikipedia from this, they say one

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:05.520
of the...

00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:08.120
Probably the key technology, you know, in doing this was Tika.

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:12.920
And so, by the way, those journalists and others won the Pulitzer Prize in 2017.

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:15.960
And so I tell people, hey, I contributed to the Pulitzer Prize.

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.800
And so, yeah, that was a big, big deal.

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:18.520
And that...

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:19.160
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:20.700
Some people only know me for that.

00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:22.380
And I had a very small hand in it.

00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:24.160
But then again, I helped invent Hadoop.

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:28.360
And we found out many years later that that's what the NSA used to build Accumulo.

00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:29.440
You know what I mean?

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.840
So I don't really care about all this stuff.

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:33.640
People ask me, are you ethically concerned?

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.980
My goal is to change the world and build the software that everyone uses.

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:38.320
You can't control for that.

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:42.240
What you can control for is that the world got better somehow in some way.

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:45.180
You can't control all the maybe actors and how they use it.

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:48.520
But I think the sum total of everything at the end, I'm proud of.

00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:49.280
Yeah.

00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:53.580
Well, this is definitely a check, you know, plus one for the good guys on the Panama Papers.

00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:54.140
That's really cool.

00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:57.540
And then last, maybe tell people about your book, your TensorFlow book.

00:58:57.540 --> 00:58:58.000
Yeah.

00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:02.580
So right now in this sort of era where I'm deep into AI about a year and a half ago,

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:07.060
I tell myself every year and a half to two, not that I get bored, but my wife lets me, you know,

00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:08.520
do some fun project.

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:13.400
And she helps, does amazing with our three children, 11, five, and three, boy, boy, girl,

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:14.960
right in the thick of things.

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.680
And energetic ages there.

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:16.980
Yes.

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:21.520
Energetic and suffering from this pandemic like everyone else, but we're getting through it.

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.460
But yeah, it's about a year and a half ago.

00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:25.260
So I was reading and I'm a Manning author.

00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:27.220
So I wrote Tika in action 10 years ago.

00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:30.100
And I saw I get access to the books and they tell me about the books.

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:31.360
And so there was a book on machine learning.

00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:33.160
And I was like, you know, it was TensorFlow.

00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:34.820
And it was machine learning with TensorFlow.

00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:35.760
And I said, you know what?

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.480
I want to learn what my people are talking about.

00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:40.520
There was heavy debates between TensorFlow or PyTorch or whatever.

00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:43.060
And there hadn't been a Manning PyTorch book.

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:43.860
There was a TensorFlow one.

00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:45.200
So I said, cool, let me read it.

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.020
So I'm reading it.

00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:48.280
And when I'm reading it, I'm like, hey, I got to go deep.

00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:53.420
Each one of these chapters that's in there, there's like a suggestion at the end on the CNN chapter.

00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:54.240
There's like a bullet.

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:58.500
It's like, oh, and you could build a facial recognition system, but we're not going to do it.

00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:03.440
You know, they author the first edition, amazing guy named Nishant Shukla, UCLA PhD, computer vision.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.460
He's at a startup now.

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:05.500
He's doing great things.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:09.660
I've communicated and corresponded with him during the reading of the book and also the development of this book.

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:13.040
You know, he kind of throws out there, oh, yeah, you can build a facial recognition system.

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:16.060
And so you go explore that, like, go look at VGG Face.

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:19.620
So I go explore it and I'm like, the data doesn't exist anymore.

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.320
You can't find this model anywhere.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:26.160
And I have to rebuild all this stuff for scratch and get all the celebrity images.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:29.780
So VGG Face is basically a celebrity image recognition model.

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:33.440
Actually, Google just came out with the product that's basically the commercial version of it.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:37.860
But it's this sort of seminal model from 2015 that's like facial recognition using CNNs.

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.360
And so I start to go build it.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:45.960
And like seven weeks later, staying up at night, you know, multiple hours at night, I'm like, God, this is like a graduate level program, you know, assignment.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.000
It's a lot of work.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:47.700
It's hard.

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:48.800
It's a lot of work.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.900
So my wife sees me doing this over like a nine month time span.

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.500
And I'm like, oh, my God, AI is real.

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:58.280
I know what Elon's talking about, you know, or this and that.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:04.360
And I'm like, and so I had at the end of nine months, basically a ton of Jupyter notebooks, a ton of data sets.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:10.140
I had built a ton of end to end examples everywhere that he threw a bullet suggestion at the end of a chapter where he introduced something.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.880
I implemented basically a new chapter and a half for that.

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.360
And so that's 10 machine learning with TensorFlow 2 or second edition.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:18.540
That's my book.

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:21.600
It uses TensorFlow, but I will say it's TensorFlow and friends.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.060
Yeah.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:25.920
So, you know, some people have told me it's not fully updated to the latest TensorFlow 2X or whatever.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.720
So what I did is I did my typical Chris thing with that.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:33.640
I got the head of AI at Google, Scott Penberthy, a buddy of mine, basically write the foreword.

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:40.460
And in the foreword, he talks about, look, in the time it took Chris to wrote this book, we released 20 versions of TensorFlow 1X.

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.700
And we also started two.

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.400
You can't chase the versions.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:49.120
All of the material knowledge of doing data cleaning preparation, building these models, evaluating them.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.080
None of that changes.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:55.860
If the train step changes or if you use declarative programming versus imperative, or if you don't use placeholders anymore,

01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:59.460
those are implementation details that could be swapped out in a few lines of code.

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:02.820
But what I really do, it's now 450, almost 500 pages.

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:04.080
It's going to be released in a month.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:07.780
I just finished all of the chapters, Michael, and I just finished.

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.180
I just went to three-thirds review.

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.320
It's about to go to production.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.000
Awesome.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:17.180
And just, by the way, people listening, due to time travel of podcasting, this will be just about the time.

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:20.640
It should be just about out or just released a week or two ago.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.020
It's going to be great.

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:23.060
Please check it out.

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:27.120
It really adds and supplants the first edition of the book.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.220
Thank Nishant for doing it and so forth.

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:34.440
But it really is a book on machine learning and deep learning and things like that and how to do it.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:35.620
It could be a textbook.

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:40.440
But it's written in my dad type of style and jokey, funny.

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.120
It's got a lot of my personality in there.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.040
I hope you guys like it.

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:43.720
But that's the book.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:44.160
Yep.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:44.680
Awesome.

01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:48.140
Yeah, well, people should definitely check it out, especially if they're interested in TensorFlow.

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:49.760
It sounds like a great one.

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.240
All right.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:54.300
Well, I think we're just out of time, even though I know we've only scratched the surface.

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:57.520
So let me ask you the final two questions before I let you out of here.

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.900
You're going to write some Python code?

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:00.020
What editor do you use?

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:04.560
I'm old school, so I will jump into Emacs or I'll jump into Jupyter.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:08.060
And I write a lot of Jupyter to start because I'm doing a lot of exploration.

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:11.080
And then if I go like a script, I'm jumping into Emacs.

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.100
Okay, cool, cool.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.300
And then a notable PyPI package.

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:18.180
You're not necessarily the most popular thing that people...

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:20.140
But something you found, like, oh, this is really cool.

01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:21.560
People should know about X.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.100
Oh, that's a good one.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:27.920
Near and dear to my heart right now are, let me complain about something first, and then I'll

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:28.820
do negative and then positive.

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:33.900
So, God, why does the Yahoo stock quote thing have to change every few years?

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:38.220
I was using Y stock quote after the old one broke.

01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:39.100
Now it's like...

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.720
And then just all of a sudden that broke.

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:44.640
And now I got to use, you know, Y Finance and like it changes just ever so slow.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.460
So that bugs me.

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:49.280
But thanks to the guy who wrote Y Finance and updated that to whatever, because I think Yahoo's

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.160
upstream stuff breaks.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.720
But I do a lot of...

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.380
I mess around in finance and quant and stuff like that just for fun.

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:56.860
And so, you know, anyways, that's one that kind of bugs.

01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:00.200
One that I really like is TQDM.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.280
That's...

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.780
Yeah, I just love TQDM.

01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:06.680
And so it's basically progress bars and it's instrumentation over iterators.

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:07.740
Nice progress bars.

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:08.060
Yeah.

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.540
Amazing progress bars.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.180
Beautiful Jupyter progress bars.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.720
Beautiful command line progress bars.

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:15.040
All the stuff that you make lame progress bars.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.900
If you just try and do it with print statements yourself.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:17.960
Use TQDM.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.720
So...

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:18.800
Yeah.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.180
All right.

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:19.840
Very, very cool.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:20.460
All right.

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.200
Good recommendation.

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.580
And final call to action.

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:23.580
People...

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:25.500
I guess I'll give you two angles here.

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.740
One, people want to get started and do more with TensorFlow.

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:28.640
What do they do?

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:33.140
Or maybe they're interested in space and JPL and they want to get closer to you guys in some

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:33.440
way.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.440
How about that as well?

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:35.840
You want to get started with TensorFlow?

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:36.080
TensorFlow?

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:36.360
So...

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:42.500
Spend 90% of your time not using TensorFlow or any ML toolkit and create a clean data set.

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:45.280
In Pandas, make sure you have clean labels.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.040
Make sure it's a tabular structure.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.420
That's the biggest mistake.

01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:51.000
Or not even a mistake, but challenge that I see people doing.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.560
They're using imbalanced classes.

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:54.980
It's ugly data that hasn't been cleaned.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:57.940
Machine learning today still requires clean data.

01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:01.820
And so you do that, you can bring it into TensorFlow, PyTorch, anything.

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:05.800
Just clean your freaking data and spend the time doing it and get a good data set.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.060
Second, how do you get started at JPL and NASA?

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:10.160
Look at our open source and other code.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.180
We have a big open source library on GitHub.

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:16.260
Look at some of our projects, read our press releases, and then connect with me.

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.400
Connect with...

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.560
A lot of our people are on LinkedIn.

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:19.400
Connect with us.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:24.140
The best way to do it is to come not just saying you have XYZ skills, but you've actually

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:27.700
read about a project like you've done or the research, Michael, and you know about some

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:29.960
of this stuff and you have specific areas you want to contribute.

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:32.700
JPL has an amazing internship program, 800 people a year.

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:36.360
We took 450 even during the pandemic virtually, and it's still going.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:40.020
It's a great way to come in school and join like I did.

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:45.040
And then also we hire for full time and jpl.jobs is the best place to take a look at for that.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.340
Oh, that's awesome.

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.580
Well, thank you so much for being on the show, Chris.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.500
It's been great to chat with you.

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:50.800
Thanks for having me, Michael.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.760
I really appreciate it.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:52.400
Yeah, you bet.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:52.660
Bye-bye.
