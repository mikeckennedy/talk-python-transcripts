00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.960
Do you think it's a good idea to test your software?

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.460
Do you write unit tests or other automated verification for your code?

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.600
I think most of us do these days.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.540
But a key question is, how do you know whether your tests efficiently verify your code?

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.720
And the standard answer is code coverage.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.780
But there's a big difference between executing code,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.920
which is what code coverage measures, and truly verifying it.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.140
On this episode, we'll talk with Austin Bingham.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.180
He created a mutation testing framework for Python

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.360
that goes beyond code coverage to actually perform this verification.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.420
It's a fresh and powerful idea.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.340
I hope you enjoy it.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.900
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 63, recorded June 15, 2016.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.400
Developers, developers, developers, developers.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.560
I'm a developer in many senses of the word

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.920
because I make these applications, but I also use these verbs to make this music.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.480
I construct it line by line, just like when I'm coding another software design.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.660
In both cases, it's about design patterns.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.160
Anyone can get the job done.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.680
It's the execution that matters.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.140
I have many interests.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.080
Sometimes you can flip it.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.620

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.440
Hey, everyone.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.800
We have an interesting deep dive into the world of Python testing and Python internals today.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.420
Before we chat with Austin about mutation testing and his Python library called Cosmic Ray,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.640
I have a few goodies to give away to a lucky couple of listeners.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.880
First, Austin and his co-author Rob are giving away a copy of their book, The Python Apprentice,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.600
as well as two free passes to their online Python course.

As always, just visit talkpython.fm and make sure you're a friend of the show to be eligible to win.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.980
I'll pick three lucky winners next week.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.360
Now, let's meet Austin.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.320
Austin, welcome to the show.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.220
Thanks, Mike. I'm really glad to be here.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.360
Yeah, I'm super excited to share this mutation testing idea that you've sort of manifested in Python.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.300
That's really cool.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.540
We'll talk a lot about that.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.680
Before we get into it, though, what's your story?

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.940
How did you get into Python and programming?

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.920
Well, how I got into programming was when I was quite young, I guess, around 10 years old.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.840
We had a computer around the house, and it was an old IBM AT or something along those lines.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.000
I forget exactly the model.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.820
And it could be programmed in BASIC, and that's really caught my attention.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.520
My parents got me some magazines and so forth that taught me how to do more complicated things than I could figure out on my own.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.760
And it sort of took off from there.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.340
Python, I have tried to figure out where I first started using Python.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.260
And to be honest, I'm not entirely sure.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.640
I think it was around in graduate school, though.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.500
So this would have been in the late 90s.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.960
Nice.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.820
What did you study in grad school?

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.300
That was software engineering.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.060
This was at University of Texas at Austin.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.420
And we were doing all sorts of stuff related to artifact traceability in large-scale software systems.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.260
And somewhere in there, Python showed up for a build system or something along those lines, and it really caught my attention.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.560
And it sort of started there and grew and grew with my career.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.240
It has shown up everywhere since then to larger and larger degrees.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.460
So it's something that I've really enjoyed using for the past, I guess, 20 years at this point or so.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.200
Yeah, that's definitely a while.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.520
That's almost from the beginning, right?

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.120
Not quite, but it's pretty close.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.380
Yeah, not quite the very beginnings, yes.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.700
But it's been a long time, yeah.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.520
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.820
Awesome.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:40.900
So we were in Oslo together, Norway, last week with a bunch of other speakers and developers at the NDC, the Norwegian Developer Conference there.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.060
And I would say that you and I were the guys carrying the Python flag, if you will, right?

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.460
Yes.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.560
We were kind of the Python guys in the sea, among other types of folks, right?

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.400
Yes.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.400
That's very true.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.140
I mean, traditionally, Python doesn't have a large footprint at that conference.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.860
And so you and I definitely were the diplomats, I think, the ambassadors for Python.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.280
But I was surprised at how much interest there was in it among the other delegates.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.600
A lot of people have some glancing experience with it, and they were, I think, interested to see or to learn more about it.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.880
So I think it's a growing topic of interest, even at not traditionally Python-heavy conferences and venues.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.100
Yeah.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.460
Yeah, I've done Python talks at several conferences that were, I would say, decidedly not Python conferences.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.320
And they've been received really, really well.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.480
And I think it's just one more manifestation or one more piece of evidence that Python is really a growing ecosystem.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.340
Yes.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.560
Yeah, very much so.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.840
And it's just gaining in popularity every year.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.820
It's incredible.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:57.300
Yeah, it is, I say this a lot on the show, but it's amazing to me that, like, the language grew at a pretty respectable but not insane growth rate for a really long time.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.600
It kind of germinated and then, you know, just caught fire in the 2000s.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.240
It's cool.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.240
Yeah.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.620
Now is the time for Python, yeah.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.760
It is definitely the time.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:15.660
So, well, the reason I brought up NDC is you had a really cool presentation there on this concept, which is a general programming concept.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.300
It's available in Java and maybe some other languages.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.440
I'm not sure.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.440
But called mutation testing.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.580
So I've done a lot of unit testing and other kinds of testing.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.560
I've heard of genetic algorithms.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.380
So maybe it's genetic algorithms.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.880
I actually know, seeing the talk, I know that it's not necessarily.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.280
Why don't you tell us what mutation testing is?

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.020
I thought it was really interesting, and I wanted to share it with the audience.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.060
Sure, sure.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.260
Mutation testing is, you can think of it in some sense as a test for your tests.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:49.580
The main goal of mutation testing is to gauge the effectiveness of your existing tests.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:58.960
So if you take the sort of theoretically perfect standpoint that you have a test suite that tests 100% of your functionality, at least in principle,

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.580
then mutation testing can tell you if your test suite actually does test your functionality.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:14.420
You can find holes in your test system, and it can also help you find code in your code base that isn't tested, and maybe you can just be removed because it doesn't actually contribute to any real functionality.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.580
So mutation testing, as you said, has nothing to do with genetic algorithms.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.900
It doesn't try to search out failing test cases or something.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.900
It's a very dumb algorithm.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.200
It systematically makes small modifications.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.400
It's kind of exhaustive, right?

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:30.360
Exactly.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:39.180
It's an exhaustive, brute force search through a pretty large space to try to just trick your tests into passing a mutant.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:46.160
I mean, the basic idea is that you make these very small changes to your code base and then run your test suite.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.560
And if your test suite passes, then we say that the mutant test survived, and this is what you don't want.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.380
This means that your test suite is incapable.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.920
It doesn't have the fidelity for detecting the change you've made, which we consider an error.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.560
Okay.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.160
So before we get into that, though, you said something that I thought was interesting.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.920
You said you have 100% code coverage, and yet your tests are not doing their thing.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:14.440
So I think there's like layers of, or levels rather, of sort of verifying your test.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.840
Like you're writing tests.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.640
That's level one.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.340
You have tests.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:17.900
They exist.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.360
It's an existing thing.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:19.660
Yeah.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:26.180
Step two or level two of enlightenment would be you have a significant amount of code coverage.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:32.360
Because without code coverage, you can have like 1,000 tests, but they could all be about some small, useless part of your app.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.200
And the important core section might actually not be tested.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.560
But this supposes you're kind of, you're at level two enlightenment, right?

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.660
You have tests.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.320
You have good, maybe not 100%, but you have pretty solid code coverage.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:50.620
And now you want to say, is this actually, there's a difference between executing code and verifying code, right?

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.260
Right.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:08:07.600
And this is a really important distinction that mutation testing gets to the heart of, which is, as you say, you could have 100% coverage in the sense that your test suite causes 100% of your instructions to be executed, however you define that instruction set.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:15.780
But it doesn't tell you whether or not, traditional coverage doesn't tell you whether or not your tests are verifying the functionality.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:24.320
So you could have a glaring defect in your program that your test suite is exercising, but not actually verifying.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:34.860
And mutation testing goes to the next level and tries to tell you if your test suite is actually verifying functionality, if it's capable of detecting actual errors.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.340
And if it's not, then we say that you need a more powerful test suite.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.340
That's kind of the whole point of mutation testing.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.140
It's this sort of adjunct to an existing test suite.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:52.340
And just to add on that, I mean, this question of 100% coverage, no matter how you slice it, is a really hard thing for most projects to have.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:57.620
In fact, most projects in the world don't have anything close to 100% coverage.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.280
But mutation testing can still be useful, even with systems that don't have 100% coverage.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:10.660
It just is going to throw up a lot of, initially at least throw up a lot of flags telling you that you have problems where you just don't have tests yet.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:16.860
It's not a technique that can just be used on systems that have 100% coverage already.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.040
I guess that's my point.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.380
That's good, because that means it would have been excluded from quite a wide bit of code out there, right?

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:23.680
Yeah.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.960
Nobody would be able to use it.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.000
Yeah, that's the truth.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.420
Yeah.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:26.960
Right.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.780
Okay.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.300
So there's some really cool ideas here.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.420
You're talking about a mutant.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:36.760
This is the idea of changing your program, introducing some mutation.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:42.500
It's just some, almost randomly find a spot and make a change and see what the effect is.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:49.420
Because theoretically, you should be able to detect this change which broke something, presumably by changing it, right?

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.020
Yeah, that's exactly the case.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.960
The mutations we're talking about, the modifications we're talking about are typically very, very small.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:03.200
And so the kind of canonical example that it's always trotted out is replacing a relational operator.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:08.340
So if I have some line of code that's, you know, X is less than one, I could change that.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:15.340
The mutation would be to change that to X is greater than one, for example, and then make that one small change and then run the test suite again.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:23.720
So these changes are very, very small, but the point is that the changes should all, in principle, be detectable by a sufficiently powerful test suite.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.400
Okay.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:32.760
That sounds like that would be true most of the time, but I think there might be some cases where it might not be detectable.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:39.680
Before we get into that, though, I just want to clarify for the listeners, you're not the one doing the mutations, right?

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.020
Like, as a developer, that's not you.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:42.800
Correct.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:54.020
The whole point of a mutation testing tool is that it will do the hard work, the boring work of plowing through your code, finding the places that can potentially be modified, modifying them, and then running your test suite.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:11:06.420
So in principle, you should be able to point the tool at your code, tell it what your test suite is, and then walk away for probably a very long time and then come back to get your results.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:15.040
And, yeah, you don't – it takes away all the drudgery associated with that and actually gives you some really interesting results typically in the end.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.380
Yeah, that is really cool.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:21.740
So maybe we could think about, like, what does the mutation testing tell us?

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:27.460
Because sometimes you might make a change and your code will then fail the test, right?

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:37.880
So if you were testing that, I select a user and it's equal – the count of users I got back was one, and you change that to not equal, for example, your framework changes it to not equal.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.380
Obviously, that test would fail, but it could also change things that I don't detect up.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.260
I don't detect.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.840
Yes, that's true.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:58.020
You can have a result where your test suite passes a mutant, and then you go examine the code, and you realize that there's really no way to write a realistic test that would detect that change.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:03.240
And this is a class of mutants that, if you read the literature, is called an equivalent mutant.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.620
And an equivalent mutant is exactly that, a mutant that is functionally equivalent.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:08.620
It's still a mutant.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.160
It's been changed, but it's still functionally equivalent to the original program.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:19.780
And for some reason or the other – and this is a very language-specific thing – but for some reason or the other, you simply cannot detect it.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:28.300
And this is one of the really tricky, difficult aspects of mutation testing is ferreting out and somehow avoiding these equivalent mutants.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:28.720
Yes.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.060
Yeah, that's interesting.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:37.340
So obviously, if we mutate it and then the test fail, that's an upvote for our test, right?

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.880
We've made a change to the code.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.840
We reran the test.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.700
The test said, your code has changed.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.720
It's no longer good.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.480
But then sometimes it might not come back.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:53.200
Is it possible that if, like, you change some kind of, like, while loop condition, it could just go forever?

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.860
That's entirely possible.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:13:00.440
And this is yet another class of complexities that we have to deal with in mutation testing.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:06.400
These mutants that – the great example, the canonical example is what you said.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.600
They go into an infinite loop.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.600
So if I change, for example, one mutation would be to change a break to a continue.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:23.420
And if you do that, then you typically create a situation where an infinite loop is very, very likely because you've taken a place where your code is in the exit condition and then where it wants to break.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.380
And you said, no, don't break.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.260
Continue the loop.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.340
And it's going to stay in the exit condition and just kind of continue forever.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:34.080
So that kind of mutant falls into the category that we call incompetent.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.240
And I guess I should back up and say there are sort of three main categories for mutants.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.120
After you've run your test suite, you have some results.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:47.060
You talked about just a second ago where the test suite fails.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.720
And we say that in that case, your test suite has killed the mutant.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.860
Your test suite has failed, indicating that it knows that you've made a change.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.880
The other broad category is that your mutant survives.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.260
That is, your test suite passes.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.900
And this is where we start to look for weaknesses in our test suite.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.520
The third sort of smaller category is this category of incompetent mutants.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:13.460
Most incompetent mutants fail immediately by throwing an exception or failing to compile or doing something along those lines,

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:18.060
something catastrophic that prevents them from actually even being run under the test suite.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.160
And these, we still count these as killed.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.200
These go in the checkbox category.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:22.920
This is good.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:30.860
But there are some incompetent mutants that do things like, you say, just run forever or maybe run for a very, very, very, very long time,

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.200
so long that we don't really want to try to see if they stop.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.740
So this area is a difficult one.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:46.560
It's one that you have to address on a practical level when you develop tools to do mutation testing, this problem of incompetence.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.720
And, you know, you start looking into the theory of detecting incompetent mutants,

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.720
and you run smack into Alan Turing's famous proof about the halting problem,

00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:02.100
saying that you cannot look at a program and determine a priori if it's going to stop running at some point in the future.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.180
And that's the problem you face with incompetent mutants and mutation testing.

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:06.620
Yeah.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.380
There's not even much reasoning about it because it's just a brute force method anyway.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.260
Correct.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:11.520
Yeah.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.640
Yeah, that's a big challenge.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:18.760
Can you give me some idea of, like, how frequent that category shows up?

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.020
Is that, like, 0.1%, 5%, 10%?

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:29.760
That's a tough question to answer on a global scale because, I mean, I obviously haven't run mutation testing on every program.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.220
But in my experience, it's a relatively small amount.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:38.640
I mean, less than 1% of mutations, far less than 1% of mutations become incompetent.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:44.940
They're not a huge problem in practice because the strategies we use to deal with them are really simple,

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.400
which basically what we do is we timeout.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.160
We establish, using one method or another, a timeout for your test suite.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.420
And if it takes longer than the timeout, then we just count that as incompetent.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:59.560
We say that mutant is in an infinite loop or in a huge loop, and we're going to say that it didn't get to run.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.880
If you consider performance part of your feature set, maybe it's failed anyway, right?

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.540
Right.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.200
Yeah, it's clearly problematic at that point.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.400
Okay, interesting.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.140
And you actually had two ways of timing out.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:14.360
Like, you could just say, well, we're never going to run tests more than five minutes.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.980
But you had a cool thing to do with baselines as well, right?

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:27.400
In the tools that we have right now for doing mutation testing in Python, the approach we take is to, well, as you said, one way is let the user provide a timeout.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.880
They can just provide an absolute timeout, and we'll honor that.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:40.300
Or we can run the test suite over unmutated code and time that and use that as a baseline and then let the user provide some multiplier, say, two or three.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:48.420
And then if a mutant's test suite takes longer than n times the baseline timing, then we consider that an incompetent mutant and we kill it off.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:55.840
So this is our really simple but generally very effective approach to dealing with the halting problem in practice.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.840
Yeah, it's way easier than proving it, right?

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.120
Right, yeah.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.980
So that would be really difficult to do.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.140
Yeah, nice.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.820
Okay, so we have obviously the case where the mutant is killed.

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:10.280
We have this incompetent mutant, which we kind of can't really deal with.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.620
But then we have the more challenging case.

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:21.200
It's maybe the interesting case, you would say, where you've changed the code, you run the test, and the tests all still pass.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.240
Right?

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.700
So there's a couple of conclusions you could draw from this, yeah?

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.480
Well, yeah.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:34.420
If you've made a mutation and the tests still pass, then you have a couple of things to look into.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:40.880
One possibility, the standard thing that happens in that case is that you just don't have enough tests.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.680
You need more or better tests because you have some change that was undetected by your test suite.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:53.620
The other very common, the less common but still quite common case is that you have code in your program that doesn't need to be there anymore.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.340
It's extra code that doesn't contribute to any functionality.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:02.780
So your test, in that case, your test suite is perfectly good because it's testing the things it needs to be testing,

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.700
the important functionality of your program.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.520
But you've got bits of code that can be mutated but aren't being tested, so you should yank those bits of code out.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:16.560
If you view code as a liability rather than something important to keep around, you can just get rid of it at that point.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:23.620
The third possibility, and this is really a subcategory of the first, is that we come back to this notion of equivalent mutants.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.460
Mutants that they have been changed.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:31.300
Our test suite hasn't detected them, but there's no practical way to write a test for those.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:35.040
And there's all sorts of interesting examples of these.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:41.660
They're a bit difficult to describe, perhaps, purely without showing some code.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:49.900
Speaking of showing, all the videos of the sessions, including yours and mine from NDC, will be online shortly.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:55.200
And so as soon as they are online, I'll put a link to your presentation so people can go back and see it.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.920
But yeah, it is tough to talk about code examples on audio, right?

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.580
Yeah, it's quite difficult.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:06.580
But for Python, I think I could probably describe the Dunder main example.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.000
Yeah, go for it.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:23.300
So one equivalent mutant that, in retrospect, is quite obvious, but I hadn't really anticipated, is the standard idiom in Python of using Dunder name equals Dunder main to set up your main block when you're writing a program.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:33.900
But of course, if you've got that in your program and you have any kind of code in that block that can be mutated, the mutation testing suite will mutate that code.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:42.160
But of course, that block is never executed in a test because it's not accessible inside a test because Dunder name does not equal Dunder main in that case ever.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:50.960
So you have this really interesting case where you have this whole body of code that's really important to your program in a way, but that cannot be tested and never will be tested.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.400
So that's the flavor of at least some equivalent mutants.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:06.880
But one of the joys of equivalent mutants is that when you find them, you have these aha moments almost every time because they're surprising, they're interesting, and they kind of make you scratch your head a little bit.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:12.420
And so it's one of the, I guess you might say, strange joys of mutation testing.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.280
Yeah, that does sound pretty interesting.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.840
It definitely gives you some insight you probably wouldn't normally get.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.220
This episode is brought to you by Hired.

Visit Hired.com slash Talk Python to me and answer the call.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:21.580
One example that I was thinking of when you were talking about that category is like logging, right?

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:27.400
So maybe you've got some test, and it says, if this, then log this thing, else log that.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:32.000
And, you know, would it really make sense to, like, write a test to detect what you're logging?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.760
Right.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.760
That's a really good point.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:38.480
I mean, most, a large category of equivalent mutants are exactly of that flavor.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:46.680
The changes caused by the mutation are things that you, in principle, could test for, but you never would because there's no reason to do it.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.460
There may be no business reason to do it.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:54.300
There may be just no practical reason to do it, depending on what values are driving your project.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.440
And so you end up not ever writing tests for those.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:12.240
And one of the challenges of writing mutation testing tools is allowing your user to specify, in some way, shape, or form, that mutations should not be performed on certain bodies of code for various reasons.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:19.180
And this is something that all the tools that do mutation testing have to account for in some way, shape, or form.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:19.540
Okay.

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:24.480
So I'm going to hold my question on, like, how you deal with that until we get to your framework.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.480
Okay, good.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.300
Because that is a really interesting problem, and I want to dig into it.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:39.820
But before we do, like, could you give us some, you know, you talked about the sort of the basic changes, like, if you've got a less than, change that to a greater than.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.360
There's a whole variety of different types.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.580
There's, like, language agnostic changes.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.660
There's changes you can make that affect object-oriented programming.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.080
Can you give us, like, a sense of those?

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.540
Sure, yeah.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:51.580
Yeah.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:56.700
So this is actually one of the areas where there's active research into mutation testing.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:05.200
There's not a huge group of people doing this research, but the research that is going on is, to a large degree, into which kinds of mutations should we be actually performing.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:14.900
So you mentioned that there's some mutations that are language agnostic in the sense that they apply to almost all programming languages you can imagine.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.980
And so a typical example would be something like replacing a constant.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:27.440
If you found the constant 4 in your code, the mutation testing suite might change that to 5 or 19 or negative 6 or something like that.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.520
So this is, you know, it's an obvious change.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.960
I mean, it's a sort of blatant change.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.260
It should be obviously testable.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:36.460
And so it's ripe for that kind of thing.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:43.360
But other examples include things like replacing arithmetic operators, removing unary or adding unary operators.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.880
We talked earlier about relational operators replacing those.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:52.400
And all of these sort of fall into – they're broadly applicable.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:24:01.260
You could see them being applied in a functional language or an OO language or any other procedural language, whatever kind of language you happen to be working on.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:06.880
But some research has looked into mutations that are specific to, for example, object-oriented languages.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:15.620
Most – well, not Python, but a lot of object-oriented languages have access modifiers, for example, private, public, protected, and so forth.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:27.840
And so one really clever and interesting mutation is to replace public with private or vice versa, to basically go in and mess with the access modifiers and see if that is detected by the test suite.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.760
Often that results in something that can't compile.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:35.540
In C++, for example, if you changed public to private, that would probably break compilation of many programs.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.740
But changing private to public, it's hard to say.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:41.520
That's actually very, very difficult to test for.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:48.260
Other examples of OO-specific mutations would include, for example, changing base class order.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:54.420
This is another one that can have really dramatic effects on what your program does.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:57.620
Or in other cases, it can have absolutely no effect whatsoever.

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:07.320
So you could see how changing base class order in Python, for example, could have a completely undetectable – almost completely undetectable change to a program.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:12.960
The only way to detect that would be if you had a test that was checking base class order, was checking the MRO for the class.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.360
And, of course, nobody's going to write that test.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.860
And I'm not advocating that anybody write that kind of test.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.760
That's not the kind of code you want to write, that's for sure.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.300
Right.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.460
It's a complete waste of time.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:29.220
So that's, I think, a fairly enlightening example of the kinds of problems you face doing mutation testing.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:36.660
As elegant and interesting and straightforward as the approach sounds, there are these really difficult, thorny edge cases you have to deal with.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:41.560
Other branches of research into, for example, mutations for functional languages.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:47.660
In the classic example there, a lot of Haskell-like and F-sharp-like languages have pattern matching, for example, on their functions.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.840
And changing the order of pattern matching is a common mutation you might perform on a language like that.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:59.160
And that, again, is another area where sometimes changing the order makes a huge difference, and sometimes changing the order makes absolutely no difference.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:08.020
And in those cases, I actually don't know how you would test for them because they're undetectable unless you have introspection and you have reflection capabilities.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.920
You actually go in and do the kinds of tests I talked about a second ago that you would never write.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:20.720
So it's a fascinating field to kind of dip your toe into, and the papers are pretty accessible if you want to read about these kinds of things as well.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:31.860
It sounds to me like one of the major challenges that you're going to run into for almost any reasonable-sized program is that it's going to be really slow, right?

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:39.580
Because you're looking at basically every permutation of all the operators in, you know, inheritance, methods.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:43.060
There's a crazy number of things in play here, right?

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.580
That's absolutely true.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:55.360
I think the single biggest practical problem with mutation testing, the single biggest practical roadblock for using mutation testing is that it takes a long, long, long time to do.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:12.260
If you consider the possibility of having, you know, dozens or, you know, 100 operators, you know, kinds of mutations that you might make in your code, and you have a large code base, you know, hundreds of thousands of lines of code is not uncommon in valuable systems.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.180
Or even not very valuable systems, for that matter.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:19.540
And then you consider the fact also that a test suite might take a considerable amount of time to run.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:27.960
So you have this triply nested loop of the operators, the places those operators can be applied, and the amount of time it takes to run your test suite.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:31.940
And you're talking about, you know, if you do the math, you can find on some systems that adds up to years.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:37.860
I mean, literally, it's not something you can do on a practical basis for all your code in any way, shape, or form.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:42.060
But there are some strategies that we can apply to try to deal with that.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.280
The most basic strategy is simply to parallelize.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:51.400
For all the problems we have with long run times and mutation testing, the saving grace is perhaps that it's embarrassingly parallel.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:28:00.520
You can run each mutation slash test suite run in a completely separate process, all at the same time if you want to, and it won't affect the results.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:11.820
So you could, in principle, go to Azure or Amazon and rent for five minutes, you know, 10,000 or 100,000 machines or whatever they'll let you get, run all your tests, and then be done with it.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:15.920
But that's not something that is probably economically feasible for most people.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:23.540
So other approaches that there are to dealing with this, well, there's not that many other approaches that I'm aware of.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.800
But one is another form of baselining.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:31.200
We talked earlier about baselining for your timeouts, you know, when to kill the test suite and call it incompetent.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:38.540
Another kind of baseline that you can do is to run a full test suite with all your operators over all your code and get those results.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:48.520
And then as you start making changes to your code base, only run the tests that, you know, work and exercise modified code, code that you've changed.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:54.140
And that way you can drastically reduce the scope of the number of tests you need to run.

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:59.980
And that drastically reduces the number of operators that get applied, the amount of code space that can be potentially modified, and so forth.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:04.120
Also, you can tell your mutation testing system to only mutate code that was modified.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:14.720
So basically, we're analyzing deltas, analyzing our git diffs, so to speak, and saying only run the tests that we know could possibly have an impact or be impacted by the changes that were made.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:22.140
And this is a heuristic approach to speeding things up because, of course, it's not watertight.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:28.860
You could, of course, make changes to your code that influence the code paths that your tests are now exercising.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:36.280
And if you purely use this kind of baselining for determining which tests to run and what to test, then you'll be missing things.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.620
So you have to occasionally do, or at least in principle, you'll be missing things.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:43.920
So you'll have to do occasional rebaselinings to make sure that you've kept up with all of your changes.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.900
And it also assumes that you have some way of correlating your tests with lines of code.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:57.360
So this is where mutation testing and traditional coverage analysis tools can come into play, where they can work together.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.540
Because now you can say, okay, I take the coverage analysis information.

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.720
I know which tests exercise which lines of code.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:08.420
I can couple that and kind of compare it to the deltas and determine which tests need to be run by the mutation testing suite.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.680
It's basically like an inverted code coverage, right?

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:22.000
So if I look at this test, what part of my code in my real app changed or somehow was affected by running this test, right?

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.760
And so you could just focus on, say, like 10 lines of code or probably way more than that.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.500
But focus it in on that area, right?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:29.360
Exactly.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.720
That's the point is drastically reduce the space.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:45.360
And I think in principle you could get this down to where you could run things fast enough that you could do it on every commit or bundles of commits rather than once a week or something along those lines, which may or may not be desirable.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.980
But it's an interesting goal from a tool developer's point of view.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.500
Yeah, it's definitely an interesting goal.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:31:00.500
Well, one of the things I was thinking of as you said this was, is this a thing that needs to run on, say, every check-in or every time you want to run your test?

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:06.100
Because if you have a good set of tests, hopefully your tests are actually catching your bugs.

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:16.800
And this feels to me like a validation of your tests rather than it seems like it could theoretically run less often and still be really valuable.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.440
I think in practice you're right.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.260
It doesn't need to run on every check-in.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:36.080
But if you're working on a team that wants perfect code coverage, for example, and that requires, say you have a policy on a legacy code system that any change you make needs to be backed up by tests, which is a common thing to do with existing legacy systems that are trying to improve their lot in this world.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.020
You might have that policy.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:38.980
This is on every commit.

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.600
Whatever changes you've made need to be backed up by tests.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.280
And this is a good way to verify that.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:51.680
Not to verify just that you've made tests, but to verify that the tests you've created actually test the functionality correctly.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:57.880
And so if you can make mutation testing fast enough, you could actually enforce that kind of constraint in a pretty strong way.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.800
And that's an interesting thing.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:09.960
Yeah, that is quite interesting because my experience is there's a massive difference among team members on their level of embracing testing and how much they run the test.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.460
Like some people are really into it.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.940
Some people only run it if there's something making them run it, basically.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:15.520
Right.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.100
Yeah, that's very true.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:23.660
And so now you have a new stick to beat people around the head with if you have mutation testing in place.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:26.040
Nice.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.820
So let's bring this down to Python.

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:29.680
Let's make it concrete.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.780
Let's talk about this thing called Cosmic Ray that you created.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:34.480
Okay.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:34.800
Yeah.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:39.420
Cosmic Ray is, as you just hinted, it's a mutation testing tool for Python.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.620
I should say it's not the first mutation testing tool for Python.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:47.780
There were a few available when I started writing it, but none of them were work.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.300
They didn't quite work the way I wanted or they were unmaintained.

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.220
And really, this was an interesting project in its own right.

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:56.880
So this started out almost as just a fun thing to do.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.920
And it turned out to be a really fascinating project all around.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:10.180
But Cosmic Ray is a system for searching through your Python code, finding places to mutate, making those mutations, and then running your test suite.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:14.500
And it's a fairly young project.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.300
And it has quite a bit of work left to be done on it.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.740
But it has produced some results already.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.940
So it's looking quite promising.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:25.420
It's about a year and a half old, I think, at this point.

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:29.160
And really, it's only been used by me and a few sort of close, trusted friends.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.000
But it's open source.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:31.540
It's on GitHub.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:38.860
And anybody who wants to try it or make contributions or give any feedback is more than welcome and, in fact, encouraged to go take a look at it.

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:39.080
Yeah.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:39.800
Yeah, awesome.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.520
And I'll be sure to link to the GitHub repo and things like that.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.920
And it's on PyPI, of course, right?

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.600
Honestly, I'm not sure.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.380
I think it is.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.780
But I don't know the last time I pushed up a version to PyPI.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.320
Let me see here.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.920
Yes, it is.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.720
It is on.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.200
It's cosmic underscore ray on PyPI.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:57.520
Woo.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:57.860
Okay.

00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.060
Saved.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:05.880
I guess the interesting parts for a lot of people are going to be how cosmic ray works internally.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.640
Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.700
There is some really amazing stuff in there.

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:14.040
Before we get into that, could you just really quickly, like, tell me, what do I need to do?

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:22.260
Like, if I've got some Python app with some tests, you know, I'm using pytest or something like that, like, what are my steps to apply this?

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.880
The steps are, well, pretty straightforward.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.860
Identify the parts of your code that you want to mutation test.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:38.480
Very often you'll have some part of your code that has a good test suite and is heavily, thoroughly tested and is central to the functioning and other parts that aren't.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:44.180
And you can use cosmic ray to divvy out and slice and dice the parts you do and do not want to test.

00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:49.520
So if you just want to take it for a spin, identify some module that you're interested in.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.300
Because you want it to happen in a non-trivial, you know, in a short amount of time, right?

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.820
Well, that's one of the other reasons.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:58.560
Yeah, you'll get more bang for your buck if you're just trying to test drive this than if you try to run it over.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.600
You know, a 10,000.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.100
If you want to run this over Django, forget it.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:01.760
It's not going to work.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.580
But I mean, not in any practical sense.

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:09.040
But if you want to run it over a single module in Django or, you know, some other package, then you'll have more luck.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.900
That's been my experience, at least, with it so far.

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.960
But yeah, you'll need a test suite.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:19.560
Right now, we only support unit tests, the standard library unit tests, and pytest as the test suites we support.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.180
But there's a plug-in system for other testing systems.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:26.140
If you feel you need one supported, they're pretty easy to add.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:30.040
Point Cosmic Ray at your module and at your test suite.

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:34.060
And you'll pass it a few other parameters, you know, things having to do with timeouts and so forth.

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:39.740
And it will build up a work order, you know, basically the list of things it's going to do and put those in a little database.

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:42.680
And then you'll need to set up Celery.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:50.480
Celery is a task distribution queue that runs on top of RabbitM queue by default.

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:57.760
And this, we use Celery to distribute work out to workers that actually do the mutation, run a test suite, and then send results back.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.540
And so you'll have workers sitting on your Celery queue.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:06.140
And then you'll tell Cosmic Ray to run the work order that it's built.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:11.380
And it will start doling out work to these workers and collating the results back into the little database it's got.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:15.500
And that's, I mean, that's the short version of what you need to do.

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:20.080
Once you have results back, then you start analyzing them and trying to figure out what Cosmic Ray is telling you.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:24.920
Right, you look at those three categories, you decide what to ignore, what not to ignore.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:45.120
Gone are the days of tweaking your server, merging your code, and just hoping it works in your production environment.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:49.080
With SnapCI's cloud-based, hosted, continuous delivery tool,

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:55.040
You simply do a git push, and they auto-detect and run all the necessary tests through their multi-stage pipelines.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.560
Something fails, you can even debug it directly in the browser.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:03.740
With a one-click deployment that you can do from your desk or from 30,000 feet in the air,

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.520
Snap offers flexibility and ease of mind.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.340
Imagine all the time you'll save.

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:14.400
Thanks, SnapCI, for sponsoring this episode by trying them for free at snap.ci.com.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:30.140
And is there a way to flag it and say, this thing you've detected here, I want to ignore that?

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:31.820
Not yet.

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:38.200
And this is actually one of the big open areas for development, is how do we let users specify exceptions effectively?

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:42.020
How do we let them say, don't make this mutation on this line of code?

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.820
Or even more coarsely, don't make mutations on this line of code.

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:54.080
Because we need that kind of thing because of the problems of equivalent mutants and so forth that we have no real solution to.

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:58.980
Right now, there's a thought about the direction to take this in, how to deal with it.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:06.980
If you look at tools like PyLint, they have great systems for putting essentially orders into comments in your code telling PyLint,

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:09.680
please don't apply rule such and such to this line of code.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:13.300
We could probably apply the same kind of technique to Cosmic Ray.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:19.920
But I'm not sure yet if that's better than having some extrinsic description of exceptions.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.740
It's basically an open question.

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:27.680
And if anybody has ideas or wants to take a swing at it, this really is one of the big things that we need to sort out soon.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.340
Let's look inside.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:35.480
Basically, you point Cosmic Ray at your module and you say, go shred this thing.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.520
And for every shred that you create, go run the unit test, right?

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.340
That's exactly right.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.060
Walk us through the internals there.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.700
There's some interesting stuff you're doing.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:50.440
Well, at the core of all of this is the standard library module AST.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.300
AST is short for, what's it, acronym for Abstract Syntax Tree.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:01.260
An Abstract Syntax Tree is just a programmatic structure defining a program, the syntax in your source code.

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:05.300
When Python parses your source code, it produces an abstract syntax tree.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:10.920
And then you can access this looking at the different nodes in the tree, you know, looking at the different parts of your program.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.500
And not just look at them, but you can also change them.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:18.680
So what AST allows us to do in Cosmic Ray is load up your source code.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.140
We literally read your source code from your .py file.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:26.880
And we pass it into a parse function, which parses the source code into the abstract syntax tree.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:31.520
And then AST has other components, which allow us to walk down that tree.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:41.420
And if we want to make changes, the details of exactly how it does that, it might be difficult to talk about operators and things like that in too great of detail.

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:42.440
Yeah.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:50.420
So, well, basically you get this abstract syntax tree and then you start applying your transformations to it, right?

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.020
Your mutations, if you will.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:52.240
Yeah.

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.360
Well, that's the fundamental idea, yes.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:59.720
So you have the AST and you find a place that you want to make a modification and then you make a modification to it.

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.940
And there's support in the AST module for doing that kind of work.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:08.620
Once you've modified the AST, you then need to get it, you need to make it available to your test suite.

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:09.760
You need to make it importable.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.220
And that's a whole other kind of second level trick.

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:16.400
Yeah, because there's one thing to say, hey, Python, run this module.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:22.800
It's another to load up an individual AST and then turn that into executable things, right?

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.600
Exactly.

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.940
Everything it depends upon and so on.

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:32.300
That was sort of the second big phase of work in building Cosmic Ray was figuring out how to do that.

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:38.180
So once you have an AST, a modified AST, you can pass that to the built-in compile function.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:40.500
And that spits out what's called a code object.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:46.820
And that's this kind of thing that modules can use, so to speak, that we can execute to populate a module.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:56.340
So figuring out how to make that available, make your modified AST available through standard import was a big goal of Cosmic Ray.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:59.940
We didn't want people to have to modify their test suites to do mutation tests.

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:05.900
We wanted the test suites to just naturally say import, you know, import of the module and get the right one.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.840
So we had to do a lot of investigation into how Python does this.

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:17.200
And at the core, there's three main moving parts to how Python does imports, how it lets you control imports.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.180
The first thing is what's called a finder.

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:32.820
And a finder is an object that's responsible, a class typically, but a function or a class that's responsible for telling Python that it knows how to load a module given that module's name.

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:36.200
So Python will ask the finder, I've been asked to import foo.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.000
Do you know how to do anything with foo?

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.400
And a finder can say yes or no.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:45.900
If a finder does know how to load something, it returns what's called a loader.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:52.220
And the loader is then responsible for populating essentially the shell of a module.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:42:04.800
So Python will make the empty shell of the module, pass it to the loader, and say, okay, now you populate this with the names, the functions, the name bindings, the constants, all that kind of stuff that come from the module that you're supposed to be loading for me.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:09.840
What we do is in Cosmic Ray, we have our own custom finder.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:14.640
And that finder is given the modified AST, and it's told the name of the module.

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:19.200
And if it's then asked by Python, do you know how to load that module?

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:19.840
It'll say yes.

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.600
And then it hands back a loader.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.940
We have a custom loader, which also has this AST.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:36.120
And the custom loader is able to compile the AST, and then use that compiled AST to populate the shell module.

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:40.600
And then that shell module is passed back to Python, and it gets naturally imported so that everybody can use it.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:46.960
I guess the last sort of moving part in this whole system is something called sys.metapath.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.960
If you import sys, you'll see it has an attribute called metapath.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.720
Metapath is just a list of finders.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:58.840
And when Python wants to import something, and some experts might tell me that I'm a little bit wrong with the details, but this is effectively correct.

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:04.720
Python marches down metapath, asking each finder in order, do you know how to load this name?

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:08.460
And the first finder that responds is the one that wins.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:16.100
So what we do is we take our custom finder, we populate it with its AST and its name, and we stick it at the front of metapath inside our worker processes.

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:27.740
And these worker processes then are able to hijack the import system, in a sense, and put these mutated ASTs directly into place so that nobody has to know they're there, but they get imported naturally by whoever wants to use them.

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:33.620
So that's the long and the short, I guess, of how we stick mutated ASTs into Python programs.

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:37.860
Yeah, you really had to dig deep down inside the guts of Python.

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.460
You had to take the red pill, not the blue pill, right?

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:45.020
Yeah, there's a lot of pet archaeology and stuff here to get to the bottom of this.

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:46.720
But at the end, it's very elegant and powerful.

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:57.460
One of the joys of this project was learning all this stuff that I may never apply again, but I feel like I've reached the next level of my Python expertise, in a sense.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:58.960
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:02.880
But it's awesome because you don't change your code to make this happen, right?

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:07.320
It adapts to what it has to do to basically take over.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.220
Exactly.

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:18.840
We work, Cosmic Ray works at a deep enough level that neither your test code nor your code under test needs to be modified to use Cosmic Ray.

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:23.160
It should work transparently in all ways.

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.940
Yeah, that was a big goal of the project.

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:26.500
You talked about Celery.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:27.700
Celery is really awesome.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:33.540
There's a couple of other really cool projects that you're kind of built upon.

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:35.860
One of them was this thing called TinyDB.

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.140
Yeah, TinyDB.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:41.980
Well, it is what its name says.

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:42.920
It's a tiny database.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:52.760
It's a little embedded file-oriented JSON database that you can import into your Python program and use with basically no configuration.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:57.540
So it was exactly what I was looking for when I was looking for a database for Cosmic Ray.

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:03.060
We use the database for basically keeping track of the work order I described earlier.

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:08.400
The first thing you do in a mutation testing run is figure out what it is you're going to do and write all that down.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.560
We write that into the database.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:14.280
And then as the results arrive back via Celery, we stick the results back into this database.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.960
So TinyDB is something that's worked out really well for us so far.

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:23.240
And it was, as I said, super easy to use, and it's stuck around so far.

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.860
I have a feeling that it's going to end up being a bottleneck in larger projects.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.740
But that's a gut feeling.

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:31.980
I don't have any evidence to indicate that.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:36.140
But if it has to be replaced, then we'll start looking at something like SQLite,

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:41.120
or maybe we'll give the user the power to specify MongoDB or whatever they want.

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:48.440
But TinyDB is really worth looking at, I think, if you don't have really sophisticated needs in a database

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.940
and you want something that's just file-oriented.

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:54.820
It's a really beautiful little program that worked out of the box with really no reading on my part whatsoever.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:55.820
That's lovely.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:00.380
I really like to use SQLite and SQLAlchemy together.

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:03.660
And those work really well in sort of an equivalent way.

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:06.500
But I'm a huge fan of the document databases.

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:13.740
One of the big selling points, what made me stick with TinyDB, is that it literally is a JSON file.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:16.280
I can open it up in Emacs and just look at it.

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:20.880
And I don't have to have any extra tools to examine its contents.

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:26.540
I think that that JSON nature is what's going to be its downfall.

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:29.120
That's what makes me think it's not going to last that long for this project.

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:35.580
But that's been a real selling point, is I can run my tests as I'm testing CosmicWrite,

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:40.360
which, as you might imagine, is a real challenge, and then see what's in the database really, really easily.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.600
And so my cycle time has been pretty high by using TinyDB.

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:45.460
Oh, yeah.

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:45.880
That's cool.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.880
And it's 100% Python, according to GitHub.

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.600
That sounds right.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:49.820
Yeah.

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:52.060
I don't remember any compilation happening when I used it.

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:52.320
Yeah.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:53.140
Nice.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:54.260
Yeah, it has 1,000 stars.

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:55.640
So it's doing pretty well.

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.780
I definitely want to check it out.

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.820
The other one was DocOpt.

00:46:59.280 --> 00:46:59.680
Yeah.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:07.500
DocOpt is one of my current favorite packages for not just Python, but for lots and lots of languages.

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:13.760
DocOpt is a tool for building command line parsers.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:20.680
But unlike things like ArtParse or the other sort of standard tools for doing this, it takes a kind of a backwards approach.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:28.740
You provide it with a string, which is the POSIX standard help output that you would get from any program.

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:33.900
You know, saying usage colon program name, blah, blah, option names and all that kind of stuff.

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:38.220
And the text information somebody gets when they type, you know, program dash H.

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:44.760
You give that string to Cosmic Ray, and from that it generates a parser that can then parse command line arguments.

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:49.960
So you never have to think really hard about, you know, building up these parser objects yourself.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:54.620
Everything is done magically, and all you have to do is think about how your pretty help message is going to look.

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:55.680
Which you've got to write anyway.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:00.860
Which, yeah, you either have to write or have to get generated by some other tool.

00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:12.820
This has the neat effect that embedded in your code somewhere is your full help message that is great documentation, not just for your users, but also other programmers looking at your code.

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:21.500
It really, it solves a really annoying problem that everybody and every programmer in the world has, which is writing parsers for command line arguments.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.000
And it does it in a really slick way.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:31.180
And one of the interesting things is that, I didn't know this until I looked at DocOpt, is that there actually is a POSIX standard for these help messages.

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:36.360
So it can rely on an actual existing standard for defining these things, which is really cool.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.020
That is cool.

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:41.540
Actually, that's the first way that I had heard of that there was a standard was by learning about DocOpt.

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:43.500
Like, wait, there's a standard for the help message?

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:44.580
Interesting.

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:50.840
I highly recommend that anybody who has to write command line tools and who hasn't tried DocOpt, take a look at it.

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.040
It's really addictive.

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:55.300
And you can produce really, really powerful command line parsers.

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:59.400
You know, things like you had with Git, you know, sub-command-based tools and stuff.

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:06.720
I guess the other interesting thing about DocOpt is that while it was originally written in Python, the canonical implementation is Python.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.820
It exists now for something like 30 languages.

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:17.160
So if you're a sometime C Sharp developer, sometime Java developer, sometime whatever developer, you can continue using DocOpt in those languages as well.

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:21.200
It's a neat project from that point of view, something that you don't see a lot of.

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.940
Definitely means the idea of it resonated super well, right?

00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:25.360
Yeah.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.460
Yeah, it did.

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:34.200
Okay, so we're getting kind of near the end of the show, and I wanted to ask you, you know, you have a company called 60 North, right?

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.460
That's correct, yes.

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:35.780
Yeah.

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.360
You and Robert Spolscher, is that right?

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.400
That's right, yes.

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.320
You guys work together.

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.580
Yeah, you guys are up in Norway, which is why I ran into you in Oslo.

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:44.200
That's right.

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:44.500
That's awesome.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.640
Although we also seem to run into each other in London.

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:47.440
Yeah.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.660
Yeah, what do you guys do there?

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:53.680
Well, 60 North, we're not terribly pigeonholed, but we do do a lot of Python work.

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:59.540
We do consulting, training, some development of our own as well.

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:03.400
We've made some courses for Pluralsight.

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:08.940
So if you go to Pluralsight and you look for the Python training courses, we have the Python Fundamentals as our first course.

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:13.840
And Python Beyond the Basics, which is sort of the next step, intermediate level, is there.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:18.820
And we're working on a third one, which is Advanced Python, I think, is the official name.

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:20.620
And that will be out by the end of the year, hopefully.

00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:21.680
Okay, yeah.

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.220
You and I, we're both very passionate about online courses.

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:27.980
Tell me, what's in your intermediate and your advanced courses?

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.340
Oh, I'm going to stretch my brain to remember exactly the contents of those courses.

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:42.860
But I know the intermediate course, we start getting into things like decorators, class properties, some of the details of classes beyond just functions and methods.

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:45.600
Here's how you define a class and add fields to it.

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.380
Right, yeah.

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:47.460
Getting beyond that.

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:48.980
A couple of things that are beyond the basics.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:54.300
You'd be surprised at how many things there are that go into the basic course that are really, really basic.

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.980
I mean, the course is quite long and doesn't really scratch the surface of Python.

00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:02.700
So anything like, like I mentioned, decorators or...

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:04.780
Probably Lambda, Lambda expression type thing.

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:10.460
I think Lambda's in there, context managers, implementing a lot of the Dunder magic methods.

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:12.020
That kind of stuff is in the intermediate.

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:17.420
And then the advanced classes where you start to get into things like what we talked about earlier, finders and loaders.

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:20.060
Or you start getting into meta classes.

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:29.980
Things that we classify to a degree as things you might do once a year instead of things that you do every day as a professional Python programmer.

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:33.740
I mean, finders and loaders, I programmed Python for 20 years and never used it.

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:35.520
But it's an interesting and important part of the language.

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.140
So it needs to be in there somewhere.

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:44.240
Yeah, and once you understand it, maybe you don't use it often, but knowing the mechanics helps you understand a lot of things often at that level.

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.760
Yeah, and you know you have that in your pocket.

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:53.000
And so that might be the most elegant solution for some particular problem you face rather than some horrible hack you would have to come up with otherwise.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:03.820
So the advanced stuff is for people who are using Python a lot and need to find the best solutions and really understand the inner workings of the Python runtime.

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:04.440
Yeah, cool.

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:09.820
So if you guys have a Pluralsight subscription, go over there and type in Python in the search box and you'll find Austin.

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:10.160
Yeah.

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.160
Yeah.

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.000
Nice.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.220
And you also wrote some books, too.

00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:15.340
We do have some books.

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:20.020
Yeah, we have – the books are based largely on the same material as the Pluralsight courses.

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:24.080
And the first one is I think 90% done now.

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:24.840
It's on LeanPub.

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.500
It's called The Python Apprentice.

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:36.500
The second and third books, The Python Journeyman and The Python Master, are in the works and will be published probably not this year but soon.

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:43.180
And since they're on LeanPub, you can get the early version and we'll keep sending you updates as we make updates to the books.

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:50.900
But if you prefer books, these are available as, I think, PDFs and Mobi's and EPUBs on the LeanPub site.

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:51.840
Nice.

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:52.960
And that's self-publishing, right?

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.780
That is self-publishing, yes.

00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:55.580
Yeah, very cool.

00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:56.820
I'm a big fan of self-publishing.

00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:59.400
So I like to see when people are succeeding at that.

00:52:59.400 --> 00:52:59.780
That's great.

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:03.820
Yeah, so I'll be sure to link to all those things in the show notes as well.

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:04.400
Okay.

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:05.060
That'd be great.

00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:05.960
Yeah, absolutely.

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:06.660
Very interesting.

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:07.480
Definitely cool.

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:09.800
Two more questions before I let you go.

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.540
What's your favorite PyPI package?

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:16.780
I saw the other day there's over 80,000 distinct packages out there.

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:17.740
That's an insane number.

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:18.940
That's probably why people like PyPI.

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:25.300
But there's got to be something that you've had exposure to that you want to share, like, oh, you should check this out.

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:30.080
Well, this is going to feel like a bit of a cheat, but DocOpt.

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:36.880
DocOpt is one that I, once I learned about it, I started using it on almost every project I use.

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:41.820
But I know that it's not that well-known, at least not as well-known as I think it should be.

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:45.280
So I'll just put a second vote in for DocOpt.

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:51.460
For my money, that's the tool I keep going back to in PyPI every time.

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:55.380
And it should be more widely known and more widely used because it's awesome.

00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:56.580
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:03.340
I'll go ahead and throw one for Cosmic Ray in there for you because that's pretty awesome and very interesting to check out.

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.020
Thanks.

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:04.520
Thanks.

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:10.220
And then you mentioned Emacs earlier, but if you're going to write some Python code, what do you typically open up?

00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:11.900
Well, the short answer is Emacs.

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:16.000
I've been using Emacs for almost as long as I've been using Python, I think.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.600
And it's in my fingers to a degree.

00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:25.420
If I know that I'm working on just a dedicated Python project, then PyCharm is a wonderful IDE.

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:30.440
And it's got a lot of powers that Emacs doesn't have when it comes to working with Python.

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:33.420
Well, that Emacs doesn't have yet, I should say.

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:36.960
But no, it's really great for just pure Python editing.

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:41.800
I guess the reason I stick with Emacs is, well, stubbornness to a degree.

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.800
I just, I'm old and don't want to change.

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:48.600
But I'm also very often working on multiple languages at the same time in any given project.

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:54.660
You know, everything from JavaScript to Python to, you know, L to whatever happens to be part of that project.

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:57.220
And I find that Emacs makes it easier for me to do that.

00:54:57.220 --> 00:55:03.300
Or at least it has, it's not, it's the best of, it's the best of breed for that kind of work from what I can tell.

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:07.560
And honestly, Python as an Emacs IDE is pretty good.

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:11.760
You can do all sorts of fancy stuff in there if you want to spend the time to configure it.

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:22.100
And if you use a package like, or a canned Emacs configuration like SpaceMax, you'll find that you get pretty sophisticated support for things like completion right out of the box.

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:23.980
You know, you get Jedi support and things like that.

00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:32.520
So it's, I know that I try not to recommend Emacs to new people, to people getting new to Python because that adds a whole level of complexity.

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:35.920
But Emacs as a way of life is, it's an interesting place to be.

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:38.640
So you could do a lot worse as a programmer.

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:43.100
So any final call to actions for all the listeners while you got the mic?

00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:45.600
Any more calls to action?

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.720
Are you looking for contributors to your project?

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:48.380
Certainly.

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:48.940
Sounded like you were.

00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:54.080
Certainly Cosmic Ray could use some people who are willing to put in some work.

00:55:54.080 --> 00:56:01.620
We have, of course, the GitHub issues page where I keep track not just of defects, but also of, you know, the higher level issues that need to be done.

00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:12.760
I mentioned earlier that we have this pressing need for being able to embed exceptions and processing instructions in our code so that Cosmic Ray can not do certain kinds of mutations.

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:16.860
And that's a big project that somebody might be able to take on.

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:24.240
We have, I guess, the two other big topics I could think of are support for different kinds of modules.

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:28.980
Right now, Cosmic Ray can only work against modules that are written in pure Python codes of .py files.

00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:32.440
But, of course, there are plenty of other exotic kinds of modules out there.

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:37.260
So Cosmic Ray needs to either gracefully skip over those other kinds or learn how to process those.

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:38.720
And there's no support for that right now.

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:40.280
And that's a big limiting factor.

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:45.900
And the other is, this is more of a researchy thing, but the integration with coverage testing that I talked about earlier.

00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:56.840
Being able to take output from, say, coverage.py and use that to determine how we can narrow down the scope of Cosmic Ray mutation testing runs and make it a more practical tool.

00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:02.840
But, really, it's, you know, go to the issues page on GitHub and look and you'll see the nature of the things that are going on.

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:05.640
Yeah, that would be my call to action, I guess, for Cosmic Ray.

00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:06.880
All right, fantastic.

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:09.460
I'll put the link to GitHub repo in the show notes.

00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:14.140
So, Austin, it's been really fun to talk about this idea of mutation testing.

00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:22.040
I think it's a really interesting evolution, if you will, of all the testing tools, right?

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:32.120
I can see a place when this algorithm gets tuned and, like, the various optimizations you talked about get in there that this could be a big part of day-to-day work.

00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:32.480
It's cool.

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:33.160
Cool.

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.000
I'm glad you think that.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.660
And thanks for having me on the show to talk about it.

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:39.520
It's something I really enjoy talking about in public.

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:40.880
So, yeah.

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:41.640
Yeah, you bet.

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.320
You bet.

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:43.160
Thanks for being on the show.

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:44.300
And it was great to see you last week.

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:44.840
Take care.

00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:45.900
It was great seeing you last week.

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:46.180
All right.

00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:46.580
