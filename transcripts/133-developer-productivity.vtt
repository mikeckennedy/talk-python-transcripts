00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.600
This episode is all about developer productivity.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.020
From continuous learning to get source control tips to tools and books for developers,

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.540
Jay Miller from the Productivity in Tech podcast is here to share his experiences.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.220
This is Talk by Thenemy, episode 133, recorded September 17th, 2017.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:35.760
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.300
ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.420
This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.400

It really helps support the show.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.420
Before we get to the interview with Jay, I have something cool to tell you about.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.880
Most of you are aware of my courses at training.talkpython.fm, but starting today, I'm trying a new experiment.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.620
I'm offering some free, shorter courses.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.400
Check out freemongodbcourse.com to get free access to my brand new two and a half hour

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.880
MongoDB course called MongoDB Quick Start.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.060
No strings attached.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.800
You just sign up.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.180
It's free.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.600
You'll learn how to get started with MongoDB and Mongo Engine from Python.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.900
And we'll build an Airbnb knockoff so you can have some realistic data models to explore.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.980
Let me know what you think of this experiment of offering shorter free courses paired with

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.100
my larger, more in-depth paid courses.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.080
Just visit freemongodbcourse.com and sign up right now.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.020
Okay.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.580
Signed up?

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.960
Great.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.780
And let's chat with Jay.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.480
Jay, welcome to Talk Python.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.440
Hey, how's it going?

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.320
It's really great.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.620
It's great to have you on the show.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.480
You know, you and I have exchanged some conversations on Twitter.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.680
We've talked a bit about launching your website and podcasts, and you've had me on your podcast,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.460
which we're going to talk about in depth in some parts.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.740
So I'm super excited to return the favor and have you back on Talk Python because there's

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.840
a ton of cool developer productivity stuff to share.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.400
Absolutely.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.020
And I enjoyed our conversation.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.160
And I have to tell your listeners, if it wasn't for not only your podcast, but me stealing

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.340
time from you every once in a while, I wouldn't have a podcast.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.120
So big thanks to that.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.980
That's great to hear that I helped you out.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.400
That's awesome.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.780
And you're doing a really good job with it.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.680
So we'll get into that.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.500
Before we do, what's your story?

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.720
How did you get into programming and get interested in Python?

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.220
So interesting enough, I went to school to be a computer engineer, and that lasted about

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.140
one semester.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.880
I realized I did not want to be a computer engineer.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.520
I wanted to specialize in hardware.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.700
And yeah, that changed quickly.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.360
So for a while, kids don't do this, but I dropped out of college.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.540
I was working as a web designer slash developer-ish.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.360
I had a few clients.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.880
I think the largest gig I had was like a $10,000 company website redesign, which was,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.780
you know, for an 18-year-old, that's absolutely phenomenal.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.080
Yeah, that crushes it.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.980
I mean, when I was 18, I was, I think, probably, I think at that time, I was probably building

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.640
decks or something like this and not particularly making a lot of money.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.740
So that makes it hard to go back to college, right?

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.960
Well, it was definitely a challenge.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.340
Being a young adult, in the literal sense, a young adult, I ran into school.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.560
Some issues, just life lessons.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.080
And I wound up joining the military.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.320
I got out of the military and picked up a system administrator job because that's what I did

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.300
while I was in the military.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.520
And I wasn't satisfied.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.400
And I don't know.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.100
I just, I wanted to revisit this computer, like going beyond, hey, is it, did you try restarting

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.300
it?

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.720
And I really-

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.280
How many times?

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.300
Three times.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.960
At least twice.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.520
But what I got to was, I didn't want to necessarily make the hardware, but I did want to make

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.140
it sing.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.980
And that was, I used to be a guitarist.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.720
And that was like, I grew up in a blues-infested area and a jam band-infested area.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.060
And a lot of musicians would say, you got to make the guitar sing.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.500
And that's what I wanted to do with my computer.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.600
I wanted to build things that were, you know, when people saw it, they go, wow, that's awesome.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.820
And I tried every programming language I could think of, you know, all of the basics.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.800
I started with Ruby.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.680
I went to JavaScript and Ruby was okay.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.140
And JavaScript was confusing.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.960
And then I said, hey, I'm going to figure something out.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.140
So I jumped into Python.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.380
At that time, I joined my first online community to learn how to program.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.140
And the rest is history.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.560
It's been five years of just nonstop Python after that.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.440
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.400
And you're doing things like Flask and, are you also doing MongoDB?

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.100
Yeah, yeah, doing Flask and MongoDB right now.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.460
Yeah, yeah, that's definitely fun technologies.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.080
Well, really cool, really cool.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.000
I completely connect with this idea of like, I want to make the computer sing.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.160
I mean, there's so much incredible technology around us, right?

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.180
We have the internet, the web, apps, just the desktops and everything.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:05.560
And like, being just a consumer of it seems so, like you're just missing out on so much of it, right?

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.760
There are so many times that I see something that I've purchased through the app store or just online.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.940
And I go, wow, I really wonder how they made that.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.840
And that is becoming less and less now.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.980
I can really start to think about how they did make those things.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.040
And then I try to make my own just for fun.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.080
Yeah, that's great.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.000
That's really, really nice.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:31.760
I think one of the actually cool ways to learn programming is to pick something you see and go, I'm going to try to build like a knockoff of that.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.380
Not to like release it, but just to see like what the experience is like.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.040
That's fun.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.980
So let's talk about productivity and your project pit.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.620
Tell us a little bit about what it is.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.020
Productivity and tech started last year as just a podcast.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:55.640
One of the things that I had learned about myself is the only thing I liked more than computers was doing a good job.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:05.820
And having others, and I'll say that I did have a lot of social anxiety and self-esteem issues that I'm dealing with now that Pitt has helped with.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.640
But because of that, I always wanted to do the best job that I could for others.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.660
And when I got out of the military, I struggled a lot.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.460
And I thought I was going to get fired from my first job.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.900
You know, in the military, you can't get fired.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.240
So, you know, when you get that corporate job, your only fear is, you know, I'm just married.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.620
I'm starting a life, you know, for my family.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.240
I have to do a good job.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.160
And I kind of created this system for myself.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.020
And I don't want to bore you with the details in that.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:41.780
But in the end, when I started looking at the different techniques that I was implementing, I learned that they had names.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.060
You know, there were things like the Eisenhower Matrix and GTD.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.400
You know, I didn't know about these things before.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.660
So I really wanted to learn as much as I could and develop, you know, my own systems.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.760
Kind of like what I mentioned before, when you see the apps and you just go, wow, I really want to do something like that, you know, for myself.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.200
Well, that was productivity in tech.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:09.440
It was me coming up with ways to make others better, just as I had helped to make myself better.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.840
And I did that by the only way that I knew how.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.820
I've always been a talker.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.420
I've always been someone that can strike up a conversation with anyone.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.000
So I got online.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.580
I said, hey, I'm doing a podcast about the everyday person and how they're productive and the phenomenal people and how they're productive.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.820
And I want to meet somewhere in the middle and figure that out.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.680
Yeah, for sure.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:40.060
How much of this was inspired by you seeing people who are doing just incredible amounts of productive things.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.820
So a couple examples come to mind really quick.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:48.160
Like on Python Bytes, we covered what Kenneth Wrights did last week.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.140
And that was like four or five projects that were released.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.740
Or you think about people like Elon Musk.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.420
Yeah, it's like, well, you know, we're going to start a space company and a car company.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.000
Why not?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.260
Right.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:09.400
Like how much of it was inspired by like those things and how much of it was just like, I'm not feeling like my effort day to day is generating stuff.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:09.600
Right.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.020
Like I feel like I'm spending all my time in email and I'm never like getting anything done.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.600
Like what was the genesis there?

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:20.320
I think the biggest was my own frustrations with myself and finding ways to improve myself.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.820
And I always reach for the people that I want to emulate.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.560
And we all want to build the next boring company or the next Tesla.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.220
But I had to be realistic.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.940
And I think that's where a lot of people in the productivity space, you know, fail.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.440
You know, they can tell you how to be productive as a productivity guru.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.220
You know, they're going to tell you how productivity gurus are productive.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.280
They can't tell you how a software developer is productive.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.120
They can't tell you how a system administrator is productive.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:57.900
So I wanted to find the people in those fields, the people that would say I'm an equal or one step above where I am now and learn how they're productive.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.500
That way I can actually apply that to my day to day.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.800
I think that makes a lot of sense.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.360
Like the specialization and trying to connect to somebody working in your space, right?

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:14.920
Like connecting with a developer who is figuring out these things and working on these things and not somebody who spends most of their time like coaching executives.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.500
You know, things like that, right?

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.520
I mean, that's fine and all, but that's not necessarily going to help you like be more productive with Git, for example.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.240
Not at all.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:23.880
Yeah, not at all.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:29.900
I want to save the actual podcast, some conversations about some of the particular podcasts for later.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:38.240
But what are some of the things that you've learned from doing productivity in tech like that have helped you that maybe really resonated with you?

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.260
A lot of it is just the differences in what productive looks like.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:51.060
For instance, when you look at people like Mike Rohde, who is a software consultant slash sketchnote master.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.400
You know, he had an issue with writing long, detailed notes.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:00.160
So for him, the best productive method was simplifying it and going to this.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.600
I'm going to draw very few things in permanent marker and they're going to be rough.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.500
They're going to be down and dirty, but they're going to help me retain information.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:15.000
And the other idea is, you know, just the sense of being a real developer.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:21.900
I, to this day, I have never had a official like software developer role.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:28.360
That's actually my next goal is to transition into that space and to become a software developer.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:39.200
But when I look at the things that I've done, you know, building a podcast, as we'll probably talk about later, building it all from scratch, running Python and Flask and MongoDB.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:45.100
A lot of people look at the things that I've done and said, you've been a real developer for a couple of years now.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.080
And that's very rewarding.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:58.780
And seeing that you don't necessarily have to have the job title to have the knowledge and the skill set and to have people that do have the title acknowledge me as a peer.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.120
You know, that's just very, very rewarding.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.720
Yeah, yeah.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.320
That's really awesome.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.600
So like day to day, you're still doing a little more system admin type stuff.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:12.000
But when you come home and get to do whatever you want to work on, that's a little more web development type of things.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.660
Is that right?

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.320
Absolutely.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:23.460
There's I think we're on like the fourth consecutive week that there's been a change on the website, either, you know, a visual change or a code change.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.140
This week there was both.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:30.280
So, yeah, that I go home and it's like my second job starts.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.340
Yeah, it's tough to find that energy to keep going.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.720
Like what motivates you to do that?

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.300
Because I know a lot of times you come home from work and it's been a long day.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.940
There's traffic and you're just like, I just need to sit for a while.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.440
And then you got to do the dishes and you're like, now I'm really done.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:47.940
Like so.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.240
So where do you find the energy and the motivation to like sort of do these two things in parallel?

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.000
A lot of it is just because it's fun.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.640
I think that that is a really big piece of the puzzle.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.980
If you're not having fun with what you're doing, then figure out a way to either make it fun or stop doing it.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.920
But the other part of it is I know what my goal is.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.600
You know, this year I've set some pretty interesting goals and we're coming to the end of the year now.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.180
And a few of them haven't been met yet, but I know I'm still working on them.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.300
I'm making forward progress.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.280
And as long as I can continue to make forward progress, I'm happy.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:25.500
But I do know that when you're tired and you're frustrated, sometimes you have to take a break.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.380
But then other times you have to remember, like, why am I tired?

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.660
Why am I frustrated?

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.080
And what how do I fix that?

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:39.720
And part of it is, hey, I'm going to build, you know, pit into this large community that who knows, maybe one day that will be my job.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.380
Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.500
And it totally could.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.060
I mean, you're definitely growing it in a great way.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:53.060
And I think there's this, you know, we often get told to pursue our passion and follow the things that we are like are our hobbies or whatever.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.480
And there's some truth and value to that.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:04.820
But there's also like there's just a lot of joy from actually like taking something that I'm good at and finding a way to provide that to the world.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.540
Right.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:13.240
And that that becomes fun and that becomes amazing, even if it wasn't necessarily like what you did in your spare time originally or something.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:13.240
Right.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:13.520
Right.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.860
So I think there's there's a lot to motivate people there.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:16.400
Absolutely.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:25.440
And if you're not doing something that's fun or challenging to yourself, then say no to some of the things that aren't and just start doing them because it's extremely rewarding.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.100
Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:26.580
All right.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.980
So that's a good place to segue into a couple of your tips.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.380
Let's go with 10, 10 of your tips for developer productivity.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.920
And so let's just you gave me a nice list here.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.660
Let's just go down the list.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:38.720
Some of these are very technical.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.780
Some of these are more soft skills like say no, for example, things like that.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:43.020
Right.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.300
So what do you got?

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.320
Well, the one that I've learned the most recently is embrace get fetch.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.060
And I say that kind of as a reminder to me to look before you leap.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.720
You know, a lot of times I will go, oh, it's going to be easy, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.020
And then I basically open my mouth faster than my brain thinks.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.040
And then I start working on it.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.380
And it's like, oh, no, I probably shouldn't have done this to myself.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:17.380
So taking the time to look and examine what is actually happening and what will be required of you, in this case, kind of like how you would use get fetch instead of get pull.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.960
That way you can see the changes that have been made so you don't make bigger mistakes.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.720
That can really help.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.840
Yeah, that's for sure.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:32.040
And, you know, the more you work in a team, things like get fetched to see what the consequences of doing, you know, giving out the latest is going to do is it's really interesting.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:37.560
And definitely branches, like feature branches, I think are really awesome for this kind of stuff.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:43.900
If you want to try something out, take the moment to think ahead and create a branch that's like, I'm going to try this thing out branch.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.240
And if you like it, you can do a PR or merge it back.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.500
But you don't have to, like, commit to breaking your code.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.820
You can always roll it back, but you might want to save it or you might want to slowly evolve it or whatever, right?

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.000
I've definitely made my own local test this branch.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.480
And they rarely make it into master.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.880
But when they do, I'm really happy that I split it out first.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.780
Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:15.480
So one that you did bring up, and I think the more successful you are as a developer, the worse that this plagues you.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.680
You say, try to say no to more.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.420
Absolutely.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.240
And I'm sure we'll talk about this later, too.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.480
But I'm actually working on a course about this.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:32.860
A lot of people are eager, especially in the junior developer role, like where I am looking now just for any kind of developer role.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.640
It's, oh, can you do this?

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.220
Can you do this?

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:35.560
Can you do this?

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.340
You see all of these different items.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.920
And it kind of goes in with another idea of specializing.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:50.580
But if you try to do everything, it's kind of like that, I forgot what that saying that says, you know, be a master of one and not a generalist.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:54.900
Like, focus on one thing and then basically tune out everything else.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:16:00.140
Like, I've had people go, oh, well, how come you don't use Pelican or how come you don't use Pyramid or how come you don't use Django?

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.400
And it's like, it's not that I don't want to use those things.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.400
It's just right now I'm focusing on the things that I am using.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.900
So I'm going to say no to completely like porting my code over to Django.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.200
And I'm going to say no to porting it over to React or React Native.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.740
And I'm just going to focus on what I'm currently doing.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.860
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:27.100
And I find, like, I'm super susceptible to this because I like to help people out and I don't like to say no in particular.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.700
So if I can help someone and I can do it quick, it's fine.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:34.800
But a lot of times I'll end up committing to projects that actually turn out to be bigger than I thought they were.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:40.280
And then I end up honestly doing not as good of a job for all the projects I'm involved in.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.320
So it's really hard to say no some of the time.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.140
But, you know, really stay focused is the goal, right?

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.880
If you've got a goal, go for it.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.400
Absolutely.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.820
And there's nothing wrong with helping others.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:58.640
You know, I think one of the best examples of this is imagine that you're in a plane that's about to go down.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:04.900
The first thing that they always tell you to do when the little masks come down is to put the mask over your own face.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:11.780
Because if you spend all your time trying to put a mask on someone else's face, you'll probably black out, pass out, and then die in the fire.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:19.480
So you need to make sure that you're taken care of before you go out and expend all of your energy trying to help others.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:24.500
Not to say that you shouldn't help them, but make sure that you're in a position to where you can actually help them.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.760
Yeah, that's a good analogy.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.280
I like it.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.480
So another one that you have is to specialize.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.740
And this is a little bit like that I want when I'm getting started.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.420
I want to just say yes to any project and help anything and do whatever I can.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:44.580
You want to kind of like you said with Django and Flask and Django and Pyramid and all the different technologies you named.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:49.060
It seems valuable to like learn all those different technologies, right?

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.920
Yeah, and I mean it is valuable to have an understanding of them.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.060
I mean I can put up a site in Pelican.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.800
I have a site that's built in Pelican.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:03.120
But I'm not spending hours upon hours each day trying to figure out how to make the best Pelican site ever.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:13.260
Instead, I'm focusing on the stacks that I use and the stacks that really help me to achieve the goals that I have, which right now are Flask and Mongo.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:24.720
So when I learn something new in Mongo, when I learn about pagination, when I learn about creating forms or processing credit card information, these are all things that I need to focus on.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:36.040
And if I try to learn absolutely everything else in the development space, I could miss out on some of the things that could really actually be beneficial to me.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.200
Yeah, it's a good point.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:44.860
It's like on one hand, there is certainly a lot of benefit to having a broad skill set.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.680
And people should have a broad skill set.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:51.080
But there should be something that you're really good at.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.920
And that can be kind of what you lever off of, right?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:03.540
So if you know a little bit of Django, a little bit of Flask, a little bit of Pyramid, a little SQLAlchemy, a little Mongo, and somebody says, hey, I need to hire somebody.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.800
I need to find somebody who can really solve this problem or have a performance in SQLAlchemy.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:12.420
Like, they're not going to go to the guy or girl who knows a little bit about SQLAlchemy.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.100
They're going to go to the person who knows a whole lot about it.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:20.080
You know, Mike Baer, the guy who created it, or some other people who are like really do a lot of stuff in that, right?

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.300
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Linode.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:11.460
There's a really interesting analogy that John Sonmez gave on my show when I had him back.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.060
I think it was episode 71.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.660
I know he was on your show as well.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:23.340
He said, like, look, if you get arrested for murder, you want the lawyer that does murder trial,

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.620
you know, murder criminal defense trials.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:31.380
You don't want the divorce lawyer that sometimes maybe also studied criminal law.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.560
You want the person who just does that, right?

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:39.260
And I think if you're really trying to, like, lever your career up, like, another notch, right?

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:44.060
Having one of those things where, like, if you need this, you go to you, right?

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.240
That's really powerful.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.220
Then you can kind of broaden out from there.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:47.780
Absolutely.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:52.680
And that's not to say that, you know, shut the window on everything else either, because

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.680
there have been times where I've looked at, for instance, right now I'm looking at building

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:03.020
an app in Swift, and it's kind of like a little side project to help me, you know, forget about

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.920
things whenever I'm banging my head up against the wall.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:12.140
But as I learn other things with just the intention of, like, okay, now how can I apply this to the

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.960
thing that I'm really, really good at?

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.480
You know, how can I take the lessons that I've learned in Swift or the lessons that I've learned?

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:22.300
I go to a monthly JavaScript meetup just so I can go, I think I know how to do this in

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.900
Python, and it's actually a little bit better.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.280
And then go and do that thing.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.120
Not to say, you know, JavaScript's bad or anything, but there have definitely been moments where

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:38.100
I go, I wonder how I can apply this to my existing projects so that I'm better in the

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.660
areas that I'm really trying to excel in.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.200
Yeah, it's a huge tension, right?

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:47.000
Between getting better at the thing you're good at and that you're really doing versus broaden

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.920
it out so that you can reapply it to that, right?

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.960
So, so very cool.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:55.060
So that kind of leads us into another one of your suggestions is always be learning.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:55.660
Absolutely.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.900
I totally agree with this.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:57.320
Yeah.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:02.780
So for those that haven't talked with me ever, one of the things that most people don't know

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.640
about me is I'm also a licensed minister.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.500
I don't practice, but I am licensed.

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:13.220
And I did study some ministry a little bit, not formally at the collegiate level, but I've

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.360
been under the tutelage of other ministers.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:21.880
And for me, I've always, people have always said like they love my sermons because I always

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.860
come from left field.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.780
And, you know, a lot of people think that's weird.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.340
It's like, you know, you could be talking about something and then all of a sudden you're

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.700
like, oh, that reminds me of this one time.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:34.480
And like you say this really austere, you know, you tell this story that's just like,

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.320
like what?

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:43.000
But at the same time, if you are going through your life experiences and you go, what can

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:43.960
I learn from that?

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.520
You know, what experience can I learn from that?

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.200
What can I learn from this conversation that I'm having with Michael right now?

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.760
You know, that's one of the things I love about the podcast.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.920
You know, with Pitt, I'm learning from my guest.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.220
I never try to be the central topic.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.580
I don't want them to talk about me.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:03.980
I want to talk about them because I want to learn from their experiences.

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.640
Yeah, I totally agree with you on that.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.360
The podcast bit.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:11.420
I feel like I'm the first most honored guest because I actually get to ask the questions.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.360
It's awesome.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.220
But I feel like always learning is super important.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:20.040
Like you said, you go to these JavaScript meetups just to like get a different angle and

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:20.860
things like that.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:27.780
Like I definitely attribute much of my success as a developer from the fact that

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:32.960
probably, you know, almost every week I was either reading a book or taking an online course

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:38.720
or doing some thing to just say, all right, what new thing can I learn this week?

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.180
And how does it apply to what I've been doing?

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.700
And it seems so small, right?

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:48.220
Like, oh, I could do this loop better or I could access the database this way or whatever.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.060
But if you do that every week for years, it really, really adds up.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:52.460
Definitely.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.700
And you kind of hit a good point there that you're not learning all the time through the

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:58.400
same method.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.480
You're not saying, I'm just going to go do a podcast and whatever I learned from the podcast,

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.100
that's it.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.220
It's no, you're working on projects.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.000
You're reading books.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.900
You're helping others.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.260
You know, one of the best ways to learn is to actually teach.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.700
You're building courses.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.200
I'm sure you've learned a lot just doing courses.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.000
I know I have.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:15.560
Yeah, absolutely.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:21.680
So another thing that's really powerful and it works in both directions, I think, is you

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.620
say there's mentorship and accountability.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:28.960
And mentorship is definitely really important for new people, but it could be your experience

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.580
and you're helping a new person or you could be that new person receiving help.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.400
And the best part is sometimes you're both.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.940
And that is always interesting.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:41.300
That's one of the reasons why productivity and tech made the change from just a podcast to

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:41.900
a community.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.640
You know, one of the things that we heard a lot was the people you have on the show

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:52.440
are great, but it's really hard to just say, I'm going to do that thing and then stick to

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:52.640
it.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.520
Well, that's why we have our Slack channel that we hold each other accountable.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.720
We have, we're all friends in there.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.240
And we had a conversation earlier today.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.420
Someone said, I'm going to do these things this week.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:09.060
And then later on, he came back and said, hey, everyone, I did these things.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.740
And, you know, every once in a while, we'll check in on each other and say, hey, I know

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.060
you were going through this stuff.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:19.420
How is this affecting your goals or how is this affecting, you know, this other thing

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.240
that you're working on?

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.280
And that's just the accountability side.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.160
Mentorship is, is really, really powerful.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.320
I've had some amazing mentors.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:32.940
I would consider you, Michael, in ways, a mentor, especially when it comes to podcasting

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.000
and developing your own system in podcasting.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:35.600
Well, thank you.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:35.920
Yeah.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.440
I've been able to share a lot of the tools and a lot of the resources that I've gotten

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:45.980
from you and that I've learned with others so that, you know, a mentorship is not always

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:46.620
just one way.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.520
It's not one person, you know, telling you how to do things.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.280
It's one person showing you ways to do it.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.000
You deciding whether or not you're going to do it.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.680
And then you turning back and teaching others.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:03.200
And one of the best things that you can always do is, is be, be accountable of your mentor.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.760
You know, when your mentor teaches you something, let them know that you've done it and let them

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.920
know, you know, how it impacted you and how it taught you things.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.160
I always think my mentors, if, if I don't, I'll, it's funny, like I'll send them tweets

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.200
like, Hey, I know I haven't sent you one in a few months, but I really appreciate you,

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.600
you know, just being there as someone to talk to and as, as a mentor, because it's helped

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.940
me get to where I am today.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.280
Yeah, that's, that's really awesome.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.740
And I think that's super important to have that both accountability and mentorship.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.520
And sometimes the mentorship is really, really loose, right?

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:39.960
Like I follow some guy's blog and I read his book or it could be really, really tight.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.260
Like you and I talking and exchanging stuff or, you know, things like that.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:44.500
Right.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:45.180
Absolutely.

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:50.780
And, and you can always just ask someone say, Hey, you know, I see you as a mentor.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:55.200
Is there any way that I can pick your brain about something every once in a while?

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.920
Or I'd like to get on a call with you and maybe ask you some questions or, or my favorite,

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.060
Hey, I, you're a really good mentor in this field.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.440
Why don't you come and be on my podcast?

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.320
And we can, we can talk about some of these things that I've learned from you.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:08.700
Right.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.040
And that last one's interesting because it's like, not just, I'm asking you to help me

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.140
out, but I'm trying to give you something back as part of it.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.520
And I think that's a really nice way to start these conversations, right?

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.280
Like if you're, let's just pick somebody's blog.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.440
I'm following somebody's blog and they're doing really great work and I'm learning from

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:24.540
it.

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.920
I would like to like connect with them.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:31.580
You could say, look, I would love to be a proofreader and check all the code samples of

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:32.240
your blog posts.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.160
If I could like work with you and just do that for free, could you give me some advice

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.720
on like my career or something like that?

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:37.920
Right.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.460
Definitely.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.700
And I think that's, that's something that a lot of people are afraid to do.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:47.340
I mean, I've, I've worked for free a lot in my life and it hurts at times where you want

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.940
to actually always ask for some type of payment.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:56.620
But if you go up front and you say, Hey, you've already paid me in knowledge and experience.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:03.380
I would like to help you as, as payment, as, you know, reciprocating that payment.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:09.680
And in the future, maybe we can continue a relationship that, that works in both of our

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.060
favors.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:10.380
Yeah.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.720
And you don't often, it's, it's often unclear how that's going to work out.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:20.560
But I found that like giving to people and helping out people pays itself back in unexpected

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.860
and wonderful ways.

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:26.720
So I kind of think that it's just worth it and it'll figure itself out later.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.140
I mean, we're all developers in an open source world.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:33.380
There's nothing wrong with going and looking at some open source code and saying, Hey, I

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:37.560
noticed there was a typo in one of your comments and just pointing it out, or even just submitting

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.320
a pull request that fixes it really quick.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.120
I mean, it's nice.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.520
And it, someone goes, Oh yeah, I didn't notice that.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.720
I do that all the time with websites that I look at go, Hey, I know that there's a language

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:52.940
barrier here, but this statement doesn't quite make sense in American English.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:55.500
Perhaps you meant to say this instead.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:55.940
Right.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:56.480
For sure.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:02.540
So your, your next advice is, it's not burning the candle at both ends, which is

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.460
really, there are times in life where that's really hard to do.

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:09.600
Like if you're trying to do like a side project that you maybe want to transition to, there

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.740
might be some period where like you are burning the candle a lot.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:17.040
Well, this is something that I've had to teach myself a lot lately.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.940
For the first year of productivity and tech, I really did this.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.420
I burnt the candle at both ends.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:27.300
I would, you know, wake up at four in the morning, work on productivity and tech, go to work at

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:32.380
seven, come home at, you know, five 30, eat dinner with my wife and then stay up until

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.660
midnight working on productivity and tech again.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.740
And I got really sick.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:44.260
You know, I, I'm still recovering from being sick and I had to take a lot of time off from

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:44.580
work.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.080
I had to, you know, have a lot of doctor's visits.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.040
And in the end, I just said, you know, enough's enough.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.260
I cannot do that.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.280
And not again.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:53.700
Yeah.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:57.260
Like two hours a day would have in the end, probably actually made more time.

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.800
You know, on the project, right?

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.220
If you didn't like have to go deal with all this stuff.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:01.800
Oh, absolutely.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:06.720
It's, it's been proven that the more you take breaks, the better you're going to be off mentally

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.340
working on tasks.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:12.800
You know, breaks allow your brain to catch up with what's going on and really start to process

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.020
it.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:17.280
If you're just going at it a hundred percent all the time, you're going to burn yourself

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.160
out instantly.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:18.660
Yeah.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.820
It's most of the time you want to view everything as a marathon, right?

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:28.480
One of my favorite quotes is that inspiration is perishable.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:36.620
And I find that I work much faster, much more focused if I'm really inspired to do something.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:43.340
So I'll have these periods where like, I'm just driven to do a thing and I'm really into

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:43.580
it.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.600
And I'll spend like 12 hours a day on it for a week or two.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:50.060
But you know, you got to like turn that back down, right?

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.520
You can only do that for a little while.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:51.980
Definitely.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:55.580
You have to, you have to wind up just saying, Hey, you know what?

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.400
I'm going to take a break and, or I'm going to put this down.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.160
I do that a lot.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:03.460
I'll start working on something and then I'll just get this little like voice in the back

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.380
of my head saying, Hey, you've worked on this long enough.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.440
Why don't you go take a break?

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.200
Why don't you go spend time with your family?

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.060
And then I just get up and do it.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:10.220
Yeah.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:10.860
That's a good part.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:11.100
Yeah.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.240
Yeah, for sure.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.280
And you find like, sometimes you come back, that thing you were stuck on is like easy.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.120
You go, well, why didn't you do it this way?

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:17.400
Okay.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:23.260
So another one that is, you know, popular in the startup space, but I think has a lot

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.960
of merit is fail fast and fail often.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.700
Absolutely.

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:31.880
This is actually, I gave this advice on another podcast I was a guest on called Originality.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:36.760
And I think like since then it has, it's taken its own little life.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.100
I've wrote it, I've written it down on like my notebooks.

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:44.280
You know, I've, you know, talked to my wife about possibly tattooing it on my body.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:50.060
You know, it's, I really love this advice and because it's so true.

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:58.260
I have, I have failed so many times in my life and I look back and I'm so grateful for

00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.260
all of those failures.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:03.740
Before productivity and tech, I actually ran a blog called Keeping Junk Managed.

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:07.420
And I did that for about two years.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.620
I would write a blog post almost every single week.

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.700
I think I wrote, at one point I was writing three blog posts a week.

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:18.420
And eventually I just took it all down and I learned an easy lesson.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.740
I hate writing.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:25.440
So it was, it was like, hey, you know, I failed with this, even though it was starting to grow.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:30.560
I felt like it was a failure, but I learned an extremely valuable lesson and I've built

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.800
many, many projects.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.760
I'll go, hey, I'm going to build this little project out in the weekend and I'll work on it

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.620
and work on it, work on it.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.780
And then at the end of the week, if it's not done, I set it down and I forget about it.

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.920
And I look at it as, okay, hey, I didn't finish that, but what did I gain from it?

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:44.760
Yeah, for sure.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.580
You need to have these broad experiences, even if you don't make them a big thing.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:48.880
Right.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:55.640
And I guess one of the takeaways is, you know, failure is seen as really, really scary.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:00.680
Another show that I listened to that I really like is How I Built This from Guy Raz.

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:05.740
And they interview all these people that started companies and the guy, gosh, I can't remember

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.760
what company it was, but that's unfortunate.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:09.760
Maybe I'll link to the episode.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.220
I can dig it back up.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:16.520
But he said, there's a difference between risky and scary.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:21.240
Some things are not scary, but very risky.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.640
Some things are not particularly scary, but they're actually really, really risky.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:32.540
And so, you know, the analogy he gave was, look, I could stay at like a pretty safe job

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.260
my whole life, but I don't really like it.

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:39.800
And I could wake up when I'm 65 and go, I spent my whole life doing something I didn't like.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.620
Can you believe that?

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:41.300
How bad is that?

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:41.500
Right.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.560
And that's not scary at any given moment, but it's totally risky.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:49.800
So I think there's a lot of these things that we can do that seem risky, but they're really

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.320
just scary.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.180
And so trying these different things and have these different experiences.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.040
Yeah.

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.760
Just embracing that for here's another experience.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.900
I'm going to get an awesome lesson from this or I'm going to have something successful.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:00.380
One of the two.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:00.860
Let's go.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:01.560
Right.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:01.920
That's great.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.860
You know, one of the things that I've always, you know, told people that I've mentored

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:11.060
is it's only failure once you deem it a failure.

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:15.060
And I know that kind of goes counterintuitive to the fail fast, fail often portion.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:20.740
But if you look at the times where you didn't, where you fell short a little bit, if you don't

00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:24.580
look at them as failures, but you look at them as, you know, just opportunities to learn from,

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.060
it's not a failure.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:29.940
And the only person that can tell you that you failed is yourself.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.520
You can only fail yourself in life.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.360
Yeah, that's a great point.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:32.520
Yeah.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:36.240
There's definitely things I look back on where at the time I'm like, God, this thing didn't

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:36.600
work out.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.420
This is such a bummer.

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.400
And really they just, you know, looking back, they look like stair steps.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.520
So another one that you talk about is doing your own thing.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.600
What do you mean with that?

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.120
Oh man, I love this one.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:50.020
I absolutely love this because this kind of goes in line with specializing.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:58.700
If you try to emulate others in anything that you do, it will always feel like you've emulated

00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:59.360
someone else.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.320
I'm not saying that you shouldn't steal like an artist.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:05.780
I think that that's, it's a really great book for one, but it's a really great idea.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:11.020
Look at what other people are doing and say, what would that look like if I'm doing it?

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:13.920
But at the end of the day, do your own thing.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:21.000
I've definitely struggled to find my voice in the podcasting space because I listen to a

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:21.880
ton of podcasts.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.440
I mean, I listen to hundreds of podcasts every single week.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:32.460
And a lot of those voices start to come out when I'm hosting an interview.

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:38.780
But what I always try to do is say, you know, hey, when I'm asking questions, when I'm talking

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:42.040
with a guest, I'm doing it with my level of excitement.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:46.160
I'm doing it with my level of concern for my audience.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.440
I'm not trying to run a gimmick.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:52.740
I'm not trying to be like Gary Vaynerchuk, who's just yelling at everyone and saying,

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.040
hey, you got to get out there and just freaking do it already.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:59.020
You know, I'm, I'm being myself when someone says it's scary.

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:02.200
I can go, I can definitely vouch for that because it is scary.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.600
I've been scared.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.240
You got, you can't be afraid to just do your own thing.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:12.960
And then from a technological standpoint, as developers, people will appreciate you putting

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.180
your spin on things.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:18.460
This portion of Talk Python To Me was brought to you by GoCD.

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:24.520
GoCD is an on-premise, open source, continuous delivery tool to help you get better visibility

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:27.220
into and control of your team's deployments.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:32.420
With GoCD's comprehensive pipeline modeling, you can model complex workflows for multiple

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.760
teams with ease.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:39.360
And GoCD's value stream map lets you track changes from commit to deploy at a glance.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:43.580
Say goodbye to deployment panic and hello to consistent, predictable deliveries.

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:47.380
We all know that continuous integration is super important to the code quality of your

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:47.900
applications.

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:51.520
Choose the open source local CI server, GoCD.

That's talkpython.fm/gocd.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:04.280
You know, I look at one of my favorite companies, Trello, who were purchased by Atlassian recently.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:09.800
I've actually applied to Trello and I got rejected, but it was the coolest rejection ever because

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:15.820
in the email, it talked about like rejection raptors coming in and eating up the entire human

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.860
resources department and the building burning down.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.120
So unfortunately, at the moment, they couldn't hire me.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.380
And I'm just like, I'm not even upset.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:24.140
This is awesome.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:24.600
Yeah.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.920
It's hard to be upset when you're laughing.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:26.460
Absolutely.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:31.000
But in having that unique personality to your own thing, that's what really makes stuff

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:31.600
valuable.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:32.040
Yeah.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:32.300
Yeah.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:38.300
It's certainly worth having an opinion about things and not just, you know, playing it safe

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.120
all the time for sure.

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:43.760
So I had a guy I worked with a long time ago, enjoyed working with him.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.140
And we worked at this office and got rearranged.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.720
We ended up moving to the same office.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:53.680
And after like the first day of working together in the same office, Michael, you talk to yourself

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.920
while you're programming a lot.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.280
That's like, really?

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:56.880
I'm really sorry.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.820
He's like, no, no, it's fine.

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:58.900
But it just, did you know?

00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.840
Like, I don't even know.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.060
So you say we should talk to ourself.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:02.820
Maybe I was doing all right.

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:03.520
Absolutely.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:07.140
You should, you should definitely talk to yourself, not only in real life, but also in your code.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.120
No one thinks like you do.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.220
No one reacts like you do.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:18.680
When you are going to achieve something, you have to be the one that picks yourself up and

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.980
gives yourself that PEP talk.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:23.520
When you're writing code, leave notes for yourself.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.760
Trust me, as someone who picks up projects, sets them back down, and then like a year later

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.760
picks them up again, it's really great to see that message that I left myself.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.760
That's like, hey, this probably isn't the best way to do this.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.000
You might want to look at refactoring this down the road.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.880
And there's nothing wrong with that.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.400
Now, maybe in your production code, you might want to clean that up a bit.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:47.980
But at the same time, it's really important that you keep a line of communication with yourself.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:53.960
And the biggest reason for that is if you don't, you'll wind up hearing everyone's voice,

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:54.620
but your own.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:55.740
Yeah, that's really good advice.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:56.140
That's cool.

00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:03.020
So another thing you propose is that we should learn from outside the realm of art, of our

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:04.800
development projects and things like that, right?

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.360
Absolutely.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.300
I mean, learn from outside of your own realm.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:14.340
One of my favorite conversations in the pit podcast was I interviewed someone who was a productivity

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:16.920
coach, but she was also a trapeze artist.

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:19.640
And where does that come from?

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:23.820
Like, what lessons can you learn from someone who walks on a high wire?

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.840
That's absolutely phenomenal.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:32.140
But when you start to think outside the box, you start to get results that are outside

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:32.680
the box.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.100
And when people see that, they get inspired.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:35.660
Like...

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:37.660
Yeah, I'm sure it gives you some really interesting...

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:38.900
Yeah, for sure it does.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:39.880
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.180
So merge your passions.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:43.560
So that's kind of...

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.560
Well, what do you mean by merge your passions?

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.440
It sounds great, but I won't put words in your mouth.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.700
So for me, merging my passions are combining the things...

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:55.340
I have a few talks or a few proposals that I've put out about this, actually.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:58.020
For me, I have a few passions.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.300
Obviously, the tech side.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.640
Obviously, the productivity side.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.460
But I also love working in communities.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:07.480
Ever since I've started learning to be a developer, I've gotten involved in communities.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.460
And I said, you know what?

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.980
Why don't I merge the two of these things?

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.440
Why don't I start developing for communities?

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:19.120
One of the first projects I ever put out was an app called Shownoter.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.960
It was a little web app that I built.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.960
And I built it with the intention to help one of the online communities that I was a part of.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.700
We were having a problem keeping notes.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:32.040
We were basically putting a bunch of comments inside of like a Google Hangout that we did

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:32.640
once a week.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.860
And there would be a ton of links in there of valuable information.

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.260
And I was like, you know what?

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:43.080
I can build an app that sifts through all of this text and just finds those links and shares

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:43.480
those.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.940
So it turned into a full project.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:51.360
But I couldn't be afraid to say, hey, you know, I know I want to be a community manager.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.780
I know I want to be a developer.

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.880
Why don't I just build stuff for community managers?

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.660
That works because then I get to use what I made.

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.580
Yeah, that's a really cool way to look at it.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:06.400
And, you know, a lot of times people want to advance their careers by doing something outside

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.140
of what they do with their regular nine to five.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:13.700
And I often say, like, look, go find something that you care a lot about and just go build

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:13.980
that.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:14.220
Right.

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.560
It doesn't have to be successful.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.820
It doesn't have to be commercial.

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:21.780
But, you know, find something that you care about and, you know, bring your programming talents

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:22.040
to it.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.760
One of the guests that I've had on the show, his boss got him into skeet shooting.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:32.280
And they had like this issue to where like their skeet shooting machine was broken and

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.460
you couldn't get it repaired.

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:34.960
And he said, you know what?

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.480
What if we just built our own?

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:42.480
So they actually built their own skeet shooting like clay tosser and they built an app for it

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:46.780
that you could control when and where it threw like the clay pigeons.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:53.280
And I was just like fascinated because I had never thought of merging like programming with

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.040
skeet shooting.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:54.900
That's awesome.

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.700
I've never thought of that as being a technical thing either.

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:00.500
Like you put it in there and some time later, it flings it out, right?

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.100
Exactly.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:03.860
And it's like it rotates on like 360 degree access.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.700
So it can literally throw it in any direction.

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:08.300
And you have your friends and you can keep scoring.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:12.760
It's like all of these different things that, you know, I get excited just talking about it

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.780
and I'm not an avid skeet shooter.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:19.980
So for me, like when you go out and you do your own thing and you merge your passions

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:24.920
like that, when you combine all of these things that we've talked about, what happens is not

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:29.080
only do you get excited about the things that you're doing, but other people get excited about

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:29.300
them.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:29.980
Yeah, that's right.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.920
You definitely already have this built-in community around whatever you're passionate

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:33.140
about.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:33.580
That's cool.

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:34.900
All right.

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:41.300
So that is a bunch of good advice for people to be more productive and more focused and really

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:46.040
kind of inspired, which, like I said, I think is really the key for a lot of this kind of

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:46.280
stuff.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.620
Let's talk about some of the tools that you use.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:52.980
You said that actually pen and paper is one of your main go-tos.

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:53.580
Absolutely.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:54.560
I am.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.480
I'm a pen and paper fanatic.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:01.160
I think that kind of came more and more with the sketchnoting side.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:06.600
I've been on a few podcasts about, you know, bullet journaling and analog productivity.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.300
The thing that I like about it is it's so diverse.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:16.300
There are very few apps where you can have like a task list, a funny drawing, a note to

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:22.380
yourself, and then like a bunch of just weird things that you've found and collected over

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:22.900
the ages.

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:28.340
Like my notebook has 32 yen on it from where I lived in Japan.

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:33.200
So every time I pull out my notebook, I immediately go back to, you know, the three years that I

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.080
spent in Okinawa.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:38.160
And, you know, I get to play around with fountain pens and try out different paper.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:45.420
And it takes my mind away from the arduous task that I'm working on at the moment.

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.460
I think it's interesting to work with pen and paper.

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:50.620
I don't do it very often.

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:55.920
Maybe a lot of times when I'm on a plane or I'm somewhere kind of isolated, right?

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:59.060
And I'm not necessarily on the internet.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:03.920
But I find it to be helpful because I can't get easily distracted.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.500
I'm sort of forced to like think my thoughts and then get it out.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:12.320
Whereas if I do it in, say, Google Docs, it's like, oh, notification, notification.

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.820
Oh, you know, that one thing I should have done.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:14.920
And that reminds me of this.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:15.800
You know, oh, geez, I better.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.440
Right.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.420
It's like it's easy to get distracted with other tools.

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:20.920
They're great, but it's hard.

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:21.520
Absolutely.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:27.080
And the other if you wanted to use an app, the one app that I do like a lot is Task Paper.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.900
And I like it for that exact reason is it feels more like paper.

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:34.420
It's you're not getting hit with notification after notification.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:36.440
I have anxiety issues.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:40.540
So whenever I start getting like little blips that say, hey, you need to go do this.

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:41.280
And then you need to go do this.

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.060
And you need to go do this.

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.520
Like that become that makes me really anxious.

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:49.300
But when I control my list and I go, OK, what do I need to do?

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:53.080
And then I just write it down, whether it's in Task Paper or on pen and paper.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.660
And then I just look at just that.

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.360
I don't have to think about anything outside.

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.980
I don't have to worry about random pop ups.

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:04.800
And every once in a while, someone will call and say, hey, you're supposed to do this thing.

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:08.460
And I go, OK, I'll add it to my list and just leave it at that.

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:08.880
Right.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.640
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.160
Very cool.

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.180
So Task Paper sounds great.

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:16.940
Another one that I like is called Liquid Paper.

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:20.460
And that's just fantastic if you're like learning something written.

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:25.620
It lets you, especially if you have an Apple Pencil, but you can do it with your finger as well.

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:30.880
Like it lets you highlight and circle and call out little sections of like really long PDFs and things.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.960
And that's definitely a recommendation for me.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.360
Very cool.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.540
So let's talk about some of the podcast episodes.

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.400
Your last one was with Tom Merritt, right?

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:38.900
Yeah.

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:43.260
At the time of recording this, the last guest that I had was Tom.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:47.680
And he's definitely someone that I've looked up to for a long time.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:50.600
As I mentioned before, I listen to a lot of podcasts.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.960
I think that was what gave me the idea to start my own.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.940
But one of the podcast, one of the very first podcasts I started listening to was Tom's with

00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:59.120
the Daily Tech News Show.

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.660
And since then, I've been a fan of that.

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.820
I've been a fan of some of his other work as well.

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:07.180
And I never thought he would be on the show.

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:12.180
But one day, they were having a conversation and he started talking about his own productivity system.

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:16.420
So then I had to email him because I was just hoping he would read my comments.

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:19.480
But it was mostly saying, hey, you know, Tom, you're doing a great job.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.660
And then he replied back and said, hey, thanks.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:22.440
That was awesome.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.040
And then I go, well, I do run this show.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:28.180
I'd love to have you on it to talk more about this.

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.120
Yeah, that's cool.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.020
And he's had such a great legacy.

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:33.200
Several shows.

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.700
He's been on several different networks.

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:40.080
And currently, you know, Daily Tech News Show and a lot of his other shows are doing some

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.600
really fascinating things.

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.360
Yeah, Daily Tech News Show is really great.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.460
So Tom hosts Daily Tech News Show.

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:53.840
And if you guys are looking for a non-developer, just general tech space, like give me the quick

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:58.420
news of the day, 15-minute sort of conversation, I can totally recommend that show.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:59.160
That's a great one.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.940
I actually was somewhat inspired to start Python Bytes from that because I'm like, you know,

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.440
why don't we have something like this?

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.980
Because DTNS is really, really great.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:09.920
But he does a bunch of podcasts and he writes books and he does all sorts of things.

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:13.600
So there's a lot of cool lessons to learn from listening to that episode.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.640
What other ones would you recommend people check out?

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.940
Well, for my shows, that's so tough.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.640
I've had so many great guests.

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:26.800
And right now, I'm kind of cheating and I'm going to go to my website and look at some of

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:27.380
those names.

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:30.420
There was this one guy named Michael Kennedy.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:32.360
He did really good on the show.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.560
Like, I really enjoyed his.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:34.220
Thank you.

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:37.740
Just looking through this, of course, I've had Brett Terpstra on the show.

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:39.560
A lot of people say he's like internet famous.

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.220
So I think there's a drinking game named after him.

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:46.220
I like enjoy talking with him because he's a very realistic person.

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:48.100
And he's also a mad scientist.

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.840
He does a lot of little projects that are really cool.

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:58.700
But other than that, I mean, I'm like scrolling through these and there's so many great people

00:47:58.700 --> 00:47:59.120
in here.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.920
People ask me these questions as well.

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:04.380
And it's always like, well, which one of your kids is prettier or something, you know,

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:05.060
something like that, right?

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:05.740
It's hard to say.

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:06.520
But yeah.

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.740
Exactly.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:08.520
Exactly.

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:15.660
I would say the one right before Brett too, Kenneth Rotter, he hosts the, what is it called?

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.720
The Dumbbells and Dragons podcast.

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:23.000
And this is where I was really inspired by the do your own thing, you know, just

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.740
really just embrace your own thing.

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:26.500
He loves working out.

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.040
He loves nerd culture.

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.480
He loves, you know, Sigourney Weaver.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:37.340
They did like a whole series on the alien sequence of movies and having conversations with

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:40.600
him came at a very, very difficult time for me.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:45.080
I was struggling with a lot of social anxiety stuff and I felt like I couldn't become that

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:45.700
real developer.

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:52.020
And then I got him on the line and learned that like, okay, I can just be myself.

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:56.220
And if that means I'm not a real developer, as long as I'm having fun, that's what really

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:56.760
counts.

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:57.040
Yeah.

00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:00.720
I think if you're building things, right, it doesn't have to be what you necessarily do

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.060
day to day, but I think you are as well, for sure.

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:03.740
So that's cool.

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:07.160
Let's go back to your always be learning part.

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:09.200
And a big part of that is reading, right?

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:14.500
So you're an avid reader and I know there's a bunch of books that developers could, should

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.780
maybe read for this kind of stuff.

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:18.180
What do you got in mind for that?

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:22.760
So I have a few development books that are sitting on my shelf.

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.580
I think I've cracked the spine on a couple of them.

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:32.780
So I can't really give you the best advice on development books, but I can tell you of some

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:37.240
really good books that I've read that can just help you in life in general.

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:43.160
And one of my most recent, you know, really, really, really good books is How to Be Everything.

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.600
And this is by Emily Wapnick.

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:51.980
And this is where the idea of being yourself and merging your passions came from.

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:57.660
Emily is what she would call a multi-potentialite, which means that she could really be doing a

00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.860
couple of things and she likes doing those things.

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.040
I'm the same way.

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.320
I've already mentioned it before.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.160
I could just be doing podcasting full-time.

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.420
I could be a full-time developer.

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:11.340
I could be a full-time community manager, but I find ways to kind of combine these things.

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:14.460
And I learned that little tip from Emily's book.

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:15.500
Yeah, that sounds really cool.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:20.020
I haven't read that one, but I have read some of the next one you have up for us with The

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:21.020
Accidental Creative.

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:24.220
Yes, this book was phenomenal.

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:31.360
I think that I like Todd Henry's books, Die Empty and Louder Than Words, I think is the

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:31.660
other one.

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:35.340
I haven't read that one yet, but The Accidental Creative was the first book I read by Todd.

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:39.720
And even at the end, he just wraps it up of like, you know, don't be a cover band.

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:40.780
Do your own thing.

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:46.320
Kind of like, as you can tell, a lot of these lessons that I pick up, they're not from me,

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:50.720
but he really does show like, hey, think about things outside while you're doing them.

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:54.420
Think about how can this translate to other areas of your life?

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.620
Think about the things that you don't want to be doing and what can you gain from them that

00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.700
makes the experience overall more pleasant.

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:00.420
Yeah, absolutely.

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:06.580
I think creativity definitely in, at least in the sense of that book and not necessarily

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:11.920
the traditional, you know, art major type creativity, but the creativity that a lot of people have

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:17.980
in their work, you know, it's, I think it's undervalued or maybe under, underdeveloped,

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:18.160
right?

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:23.800
Like we don't spend enough time like just focusing on being creative problem solvers and creative

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:24.200
thinkers.

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.160
Right.

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.140
So it's good to remind you to do that.

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:27.620
Absolutely.

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:28.000
Yeah.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.340
So the next one is how to be positive when telling people, no, I'm too busy.

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:32.860
Yeah.

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:36.720
The Power of a Positive No by William Ury is, is, it's an older book.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:40.920
He's actually written some other really good books that I'd highly suggest you check out.

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:46.040
But, but this one, this one really helped, especially if you're dealing with social anxiety.

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:50.300
If you feel like you have to please everyone, I would highly recommend reading this book.

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:57.480
William is someone who, he's been a negotiator and he's negotiated a lot of peace treaties.

00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:00.060
He's negotiated international conflicts.

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:03.700
He sat down with the people that were involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:11.380
So he brings a lot of knowledge in and really teaches you how to develop this system around

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:16.880
saying no and really unlock the things that you want to say yes to and, and really having

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.200
the power to do that.

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.660
It's called the power of a positive no for a reason.

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:25.680
Once you learn some of these techniques, you start to realize like, wow, I didn't even

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:26.620
know I could do that.

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:26.940
Yeah.

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:27.820
That's interesting.

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:32.860
You know, I feel like a lot of times people miss opportunities because they come by and

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:33.780
they're like, ah, I'm so busy.

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:34.620
I can't deal with this.

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:34.940
Right.

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:37.160
Like I would love to go do that, but I got X, Y, and Z.

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:37.460
Right.

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:41.280
And so this sounds like it might keep a little slack in the system for that.

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.000
It definitely does.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:42.260
Yeah.

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:42.540
Nice.

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:44.300
The next one's about running.

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:48.120
I think you can learn a lot of life lessons from these types of endurance things.

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:48.480
Yeah.

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:53.620
And this book, what I talk about when I talk about running by Haruki Murakami, I picked

00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:56.540
this book up years ago and never read it.

00:52:56.540 --> 00:53:00.880
And then I finally sat down earlier this year to read it and was mad at myself for waiting

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:01.460
so long.

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:03.340
Haruki is an author.

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:04.240
He's a fiction writer.

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:07.180
And I've read several of his fiction books.

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.000
He's one of my favorite fiction writers.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:15.520
But in this, he talks about the life that he has outside of writing, which is, you know,

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:19.240
he's a marathon runner and he does this every day.

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:24.620
And it teaches, you know, it teaches you a lot about the power of creating a habit and really

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:27.440
having that habit work for you.

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.180
You know, we can't be developers 24-7.

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:34.060
I know some of us try, but we cannot be developers 24-7.

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:39.180
And when we do these other things, kind of like what Ken Rotter was doing with, we're going

00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:43.220
to the gym or joining a D&D group or reading a good book.

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:48.820
When you do these things, it really helps not just with your mental health and your physical

00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:53.640
health, but it also helps on the development side because it helps keep your brain engaged

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.240
in learning different things.

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:55.560
Yeah.

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:56.740
That sounds interesting.

00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:59.280
And the last one, what's this last one here?

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.140
So the last one is a fiction book.

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:08.780
It's, I've always been fascinated with the counter-revolution that happened in China about a hundred years

00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:10.300
ago at this point.

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:13.340
But this book is called Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress.

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:16.820
It's by a Chinese French author named Dai Seji.

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:21.740
And I've read this book once a year for the past five years.

00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:24.900
I'm actually about to come up to the point where I'm going to read it again for this year.

00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:27.640
And it's just a really beautiful story.

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:31.960
And it takes place in the ancient villages of China.

00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:37.320
For those that don't know about the counter-revolution, what Emperor Mao used to do was he would take

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:44.680
some of the smartest people, the doctors, the politicians, the activists, the lawyers, and

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:50.300
he would take their children and put them in a re-education system where they would send them to

00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:55.560
these remote islands, or not islands, but these remote villages where there were maybe like 20

00:54:55.560 --> 00:55:00.560
people and there was no electricity and no television and no radios and anything else.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:05.000
And in the book, they even, they become fascinated with an alarm clock because it allows them to wake

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.020
up on time early without having to ignore everything, you know, without sleeping in.

00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:10.820
I don't know.

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:15.280
Every time I read this book, I just, I look at my life and I just think about how good I have it.

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:19.640
Because I grew up in an era that I did not have to deal with some of these things.

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:23.800
And, you know, as an African-American, as a minority in the tech space, there are a lot of

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.780
issues that are out there.

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:30.920
And I look at those issues and I acknowledge them, but I continue to push myself regardless

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:33.240
because I know that it could definitely be worse.

00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:36.360
Yeah, that sounds like a really interesting set of life lessons in there.

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:37.380
That's, that's cool.

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:39.260
And I love the lesson that you're taking from it.

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:39.660
That's great.

00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:43.480
So I actually have two books I want to throw onto the list here.

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:45.240
These are not your books, but, but mine.

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:49.280
And I recently read them and I thought they were just incredible and related to this.

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:52.040
One was the biography of Elon Musk.

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:55.900
It's called Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and the quest for a fantastic future.

00:55:55.900 --> 00:56:02.020
And just reading what Elon Musk has done and continues to do makes you feel like,

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:06.300
oh my gosh, I've got to get out there and do something because he's, he's starting a space

00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:08.240
company, a car company, a solar company.

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:12.300
You know, he's just like, you read about the passion and the drive and the focus.

00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:15.820
And it's like, you can't help but want to like go do more.

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:17.580
So that's really cool.

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:21.600
And then the other one is a surprising book I ran across somewhere right before I jumped

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:25.200
on a plane called hustle, the life changing effects of constant motion.

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:34.580
And this guy, Jesse Tevlov wrote this book and basically he's been working on like productivity,

00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:42.460
focus, creativity type things, creating things in the creative space and super relevant for

00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:45.620
people in development and projects like that.

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:48.780
And it's just, it really touches on a lot of, a lot of cool things.

00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:55.120
Basically, you know, inspires you to keep moving, always take a step forward, always get at least

00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.880
some progress on whatever your, your real important goals are.

00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:58.400
It's great.

00:56:58.400 --> 00:56:58.920
Absolutely.

00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:04.420
And I think that a lot of developers are afraid to embrace their creative side.

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:10.200
I mean, there's, we were supposed to think logically and analytically, but really we're,

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:11.080
we're creative.

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:15.260
I mean, it, it takes creativity to build a website.

00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:20.300
Like, I mean, sure you can follow a template, but that's boring and you want to make it your

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:22.000
own thing and you try all these new things.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.740
And the only way you get to those things is by truly being creative.

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:25.120
Yeah.

00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:28.600
That's the surprising thing about, I think, programming is you think of all these rules

00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:33.380
and you've got to follow what the programming languages and the APIs sort of boxes into.

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:39.800
But once those boxes and that, that space is built, then it's just full of creative problem

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:40.880
solving and creative thinking.

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.500
And it's, it's really a wonderful space.

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:44.420
So definitely important.

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:48.320
So Jay, we're getting short on time and getting near the end of the show.

00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:50.060
So you mentioned your course.

00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:52.120
Why don't you tell everybody what you're up to with your course?

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:55.040
So my upcoming course is called learn to say no.

00:57:55.040 --> 00:58:03.560
It is designed for people like us, like developers to learn how to embrace no, kind of like what,

00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:05.360
uh, the power of a positive no was saying.

00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:10.400
however, this comes from a position specifically in tech.

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:15.020
You know, we're going to be talking about saying no to yourself when you want to stay up late

00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:16.320
and burn the candle at both ends.

00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:21.540
Saying no to your boss when they want to add a ton of work onto your project and, and

00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:27.860
kind of takes us to take things off the rails and, and saying no to being that resident

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:30.880
IT guy for your family or girl.

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:36.600
But ultimately we're learning to say no so we can eventually say yes and say yes to the

00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:39.660
things that we want to and the things that are going to continue to empower us.

00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:42.220
But you can't get to yes before you get to no.

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:46.000
And I've learned a lot just preparing for this course.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.660
And I think a lot of people are going to learn from it as well.

00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:48.900
Nice.

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:51.080
People are interested how they find out when it comes out.

00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:53.220
So we do have a landing page up.

00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:56.440
If you go to productivityintech.com, if it's your first time visiting the site, you're going

00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:59.460
to get a little pop-up at the top of the screen that says learn about our upcoming course.

00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:02.500
And if you click on that, you can sign up for our waiting list.

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:09.020
In there, I will, I will send you some sneak peeks down the road, but I'll also will let

00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:11.920
you know the status of where I'm, where I'm at with the course.

00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:15.840
And when I expect it to come out right now, we don't have a release date at the time of

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.160
recording, but the plan is to have it out by the end of the year.

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:18.500
All right.

00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:18.980
Sounds cool.

00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:20.300
All right.

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:22.080
I think we're going to have to leave it there for the topic.

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:23.920
So let me ask you the two questions.

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:27.740
So if you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you open up?

00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:28.860
It really just depends.

00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:33.640
When we first started preparing for this conversation, it was one thing and now it's another one.

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:40.080
I normally use Atom or I'll use Vim for quick fixes, but Sublime Text 3 just came out.

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:42.800
So I'm giving that a shot and I like it.

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:44.880
There's a lot of cool things about it.

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:45.740
Oh, that's really cool.

00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:46.800
I'll have to go check that out.

00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:47.580
I haven't even noticed.

00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:48.260
It's awesome.

00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:51.260
Notable PyPI package.

00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:57.360
I love requests and I love requests because I am always like trying to connect to an API.

00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:03.140
I'm always like for some reason, constantly pulling in like traffic.

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:09.040
BeautifulSoup would definitely be a close second because that's where those were like the two

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:14.480
big packages that I used originally, like when I first started developing in Python.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:19.100
But yeah, at this point, it's BeautifulSoup, not as much, but I still use

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:21.100
requests in almost every single project.

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:29.120
Yeah, that project is, of course, one of, if not the most popular PyPI packages, but it really captures

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:34.660
the essence of the import anti-gravity KCXD comic.

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:37.040
So it's great.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:37.720
All right.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.700
So final call to action.

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.380
People want to be more productive.

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:41.580
What should they do?

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:45.840
So I would highly suggest that you center yourself around a community.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.780
Don't think that you have to be productive on your own.

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:52.700
Don't think that you have to try to make a bunch of life changes all on your own.

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:57.760
And when you fail, don't get discouraged and feel like you're just a massive failure.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.120
Instead, get out, get involved in a community.

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:05.040
I happen to know one called the Productivity and Tech Premium Group.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.980
It is a paid for group.

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:12.180
But the reason that we pay for it is because we want everybody in there to feel like they

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:16.800
have to contribute to the community and they have to grow with each other.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:21.360
And it really has created a lot of amazing things.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:27.000
A lot of life changes have happened in that group that I don't think would have happened.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.820
I've had people say, you know, I was afraid to do this thing until I joined this community.

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:35.720
And I had people cheering behind me saying, hey, you can do this.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:36.220
You can do this.

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:36.680
You can do this.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.440
And in the end, I did.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.280
So don't do it on your own.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.420
Get involved.

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:42.580
Get plugged into a community.

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:47.040
If you want to join the Productivity and Tech community, start by listening to the podcast

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:50.840
first to make sure that we're going to provide you what you need.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:56.060
And then go to productivityintech.com slash premium slash talk python.

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:59.480
And I'm going to give you two thirds off for life.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.480
So instead of paying the $30 a month, you'll only have to pay $10 a month.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.760
And that is for the life of your membership.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:07.360
Yeah.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.140
Yeah, that's really cool.

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:10.660
That's a nice project you got going there.

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:16.620
And it definitely helps to have someone who's sort of at your level trying to solve the

01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:20.100
same problems or work on the same types of things or reach the same goals that you are.

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:24.320
So I have people that I meet up with weekly or every other week or something like that.

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:28.220
And we can share and exchange notes and see how we're doing and keep each other motivated.

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:29.780
So yeah, very, very cool.

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:31.080
All right, Jay.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.740
Thanks for being on Talk Python.

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:38.080
