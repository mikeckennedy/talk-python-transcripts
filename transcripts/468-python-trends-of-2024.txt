00:00:00 I've gathered a group of Python experts who have been thinking deeply about where Python

00:00:04 is going and who have lived through where it has been.

00:00:07 This episode is all about near-term Python trends and things we each believe will be

00:00:12 important to focus on as Python continues to grow.

00:00:15 Our panelists are Jody Burchell, Carol Willing, and Paul Everett.

00:00:20 This is Talk Python to Me episode 468, recorded June 18th, 2024.

00:02:39 All Jodi and Carol, welcome back to Talk Python and me for all of you.

00:02:43 Great to have you all back.

00:02:45 Great to be back.

00:02:46 Thanks for having us.

00:02:47 Jodi, your latest episode is going to come out tomorrow.

00:02:50 So we're on a tight loop here.

00:02:52 This excellent data science panel thing we did at PyCon was really fun.

00:02:57 So but now we're back for a different panel.

00:03:00 Yes.

00:03:01 We're going to talk about Python trends and just what we all think is something people

00:03:06 out there should be paying attention to.

00:03:07 I'll have slightly different backgrounds, which I think is going to make it really interesting

00:03:11 as well.

00:03:12 So since people don't listen to every episode, maybe quick introductions.

00:03:15 Jodi, quick introduction for you.

00:03:18 We'll go around.

00:03:19 Sure.

00:03:20 So my name is Jodi Burchell.

00:03:21 I'm currently working at JetBrains with Paul.

00:03:23 Paul's actually my boss.

00:03:25 And I'm working as the developer advocate in data science.

00:03:28 So I've been a data scientist for around eight years.

00:03:32 And prior to that, I was an academic like many data scientists.

00:03:36 And my background is actually psychology.

00:03:38 So if you also want to ask me about anxiety disorders or emotions, you can ask me about

00:03:43 these things.

00:03:44 In open source?

00:03:45 No way.

00:03:46 Awesome.

00:03:47 Great to have you back.

00:03:48 Carol?

00:03:49 Yeah.

00:03:50 Hi, I'm Carol Willing.

00:03:51 I'm really happy to be here today.

00:03:52 I am half retired, half doing consulting for early stage companies that are interested

00:04:03 in data science and have a particular love for open science.

00:04:07 I am a core developer and former steering council member for Python and also on the

00:04:13 Jupyter team.

00:04:14 So my real passions though are education and lifelong learning.

00:04:20 So I'm really excited to talk about some of the trends that I'm seeing.

00:04:24 Yeah.

00:04:25 Fantastic.

00:04:26 Paul?

00:04:27 Hi, I'm Paul Everett.

00:04:28 I'm president of the Carol Willing Fan Club.

00:04:29 I'm a lifetime member.

00:04:31 You get a special coin for that too.

00:04:33 And when I'm not doing that, I'm a JetBrains, Python and web advocate.

00:04:38 I have a bit of a long time love affair with Python and the web, which I hope that we'll

00:04:43 talk about.

00:04:44 Yeah.

00:04:45 You worked on early, early web frameworks in Python.

00:04:47 Those Django people, they were thinking about what Paul and team did before that, right?

00:04:52 Django was the thing that killed us.

00:04:54 Haven't gotten over that Django.

00:04:55 I didn't mean to bring it up.

00:04:56 I didn't mean to bring it up.

00:04:57 I'm over it really.

00:04:58 We'll get you some therapy later.

00:05:01 No.

00:05:02 Awesome.

00:05:03 Great to have you all here.

00:05:04 Our plan is to just, you know, we all brought a couple of ideas, introduce them and just

00:05:08 have a little group chat, you know, casual chat.

00:05:11 I like, well, do we really think it's going that way?

00:05:14 What's important?

00:05:15 What should we be paying attention to?

00:05:16 And where's it going?

00:05:17 So Jody, I know you gave a fun talk at PyCon US.

00:05:22 Those are not up those videos yet, are they?

00:05:24 I haven't seen them.

00:05:25 No, no.

00:05:26 You still, they're still behind the paywall.

00:05:27 So if you attended the conference, you can view them, but otherwise not available to

00:05:30 the public yet, I'm afraid.

00:05:32 Not yet.

00:05:33 They'll be out.

00:05:34 So hopefully we can share.

00:05:35 I know it's somewhat relevant to what your, some of your ideas, but let's go with your

00:05:38 first friend and the coming years or the immediate near, near term.

00:05:44 For the immediate term.

00:05:45 I don't know if this will be good news to people, but LLMs are not going anywhere just

00:05:49 yet.

00:05:50 So I actually did a bit of research for this episode and what I wanted to see, you know,

00:05:56 data scientists is what the download numbers on different packages on PyPI look like.

00:06:02 So there's particular package transformers, which is one of the main packages for interfacing

00:06:06 with LLMs, the open source ones on Hugging Face and the download numbers of that have

00:06:12 doubled in, not sorry, gone up 50% in the last six months.

00:06:16 And then now comparable to the big sort of deep learning packages like Keras, TensorFlow

00:06:23 and PyTorch, which is quite interesting.

00:06:25 Yeah.

00:06:26 Unfortunately for those of you who are sick of LLMs not going anywhere, but this year

00:06:31 we're sort of seeing a bit of a change in how LLMs are used.

00:06:34 So I think last year it was a bit like blinded by the proprietary sort of models and the

00:06:39 sort of walled garden.

00:06:41 This year I think we're seeing more of a sort of open source fight back.

00:06:46 So LLMs are starting to be used as part of more multi-part applications and there are

00:06:51 open source packages like that.

00:06:53 Blockchain is the most popular and the downloads of that one have doubled in the last six months.

00:06:57 We have alternatives like Haystack and Llama Index.

00:07:01 And then RAG, of course, Retrieval Augmented Generation is one of the big topics and we're

00:07:06 seeing the ecosystem around that growing.

00:07:08 So libraries like Unstructured to work with a whole bunch of text inputs, Weaviate, vector

00:07:13 databases like that.

00:07:14 And then of course, smaller language models are becoming...

00:07:18 People are realizing it's really hard to deploy and work with the big ones.

00:07:21 So smaller models, which are more domain specific, which are trained on more specific data, they're

00:07:26 becoming a lot more widely used and people are talking about them more.

00:07:30 I 100% agree with you.

00:07:32 I think people may be tired of hearing about AI and LLMs, but they're only going to hear

00:07:38 more about it.

00:07:39 So I think it's pretty interesting.

00:07:40 I want to hear what Carol and Paul have and then maybe an angle we could pursue that is

00:07:46 super relevant to all of us.

00:07:47 I'm going to jump in.

00:07:48 I just came back from Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Open Science Conference in Boston last week.

00:07:55 And LLMs, the whole ecosystem is here to stay.

00:07:59 And I think the key is, it's not going anywhere anytime soon.

00:08:04 And like I shared in my PyTexas keynote, AI has been around since the 1950s.

00:08:10 So it has been a gradual progression.

00:08:13 It's just right now we have more compute power than ever before, which has opened the doors

00:08:19 to many new things.

00:08:20 I think what was top of mind with many of the folks that were at this event was, you

00:08:27 know, there's a lot of good that it can bring to science in terms of making things more

00:08:32 natural language focused and changing the user interface with which we communicate with

00:08:39 our data.

00:08:40 But at the same time, if you're doing trusted things and dealing with medical patients,

00:08:46 you still need some check and balance.

00:08:50 And you know, we're not there yet.

00:08:52 Will we ever be there?

00:08:53 Maybe not.

00:08:54 But it's a fascinating area to kind of go deeper in.

00:08:58 One thing I want to highlight is about six months ago, Andres Carpathi did a really good

00:09:05 intro to large language models talk, which was really accessible to not just computer

00:09:13 scientists, but beyond that.

00:09:15 And I think he took a really balanced view of a what things are, how things work, what's

00:09:21 on the horizon and what are some of the concerns with security and other things.

00:09:25 So I completely agree with Jody.

00:09:27 We're not we're not it's going to be there for a long time.

00:09:30 A couple of comments on the comments.

00:09:32 First, your point about we've seen this movie before under other names like neural networks

00:09:38 and stuff like that.

00:09:39 I believe it was Glyph had a good post about this.

00:09:43 Really cynical mastodon about a month ago about these Glyph cycles.

00:09:48 And where are we in the current hype cycle?

00:09:50 I think his point was we're at the phase where the people who've put all the money in need

00:09:56 to keep pumping it up for the people who will come after them and take the fall.

00:10:02 Paul, are you saying we're in the Pets.com era of LLMs?

00:10:06 Yes, we are.

00:10:07 That is a pithy, pithy way to put it.

00:10:09 You should trademark that.

00:10:11 Simon Willison is someone to give a shout out for storytelling about what all this means.

00:10:15 I think Simon's to the point of getting quoted in the New York Times now.

00:10:19 So it's good that we've got one of us out there helping to get the story straight.

00:10:25 I have a question for you.

00:10:26 You mentioned that about going to Chan Zuckerberg's conference.

00:10:31 Mozilla has gotten into funding AI as part of their mission, which kind of caught me

00:10:39 off guard.

00:10:40 Do you have any backstory on that to kind of make us feel good that there's someone

00:10:44 out there who believes in open AI?

00:10:47 Oh, wow.

00:10:48 Open AI is sort of, well, okay, an open AI, not the company.

00:10:54 I tend to call it transparent and trusted AI because I think open AI doesn't capture

00:11:01 quite the right feeling.

00:11:02 Good point.

00:11:03 I think it's not just, we talk about open source software, but when we talk about these

00:11:09 models, the data is equally as important as is the infrastructure and the processes which

00:11:17 we use.

00:11:18 And governance.

00:11:19 Mozilla, I think, has been sort of for a while, like kind of circling around the space.

00:11:25 They do a lot of work with data.

00:11:27 They've done a lot of good work like Iodide, which we might chat about later.

00:11:31 But Chan Zuckerberg, again, you know, the money comes from meta and the success that

00:11:38 Mark Zuckerberg has had.

00:11:40 The nonprofit, the CZI initiative is really focused on curing all diseases in the next

00:11:48 century.

00:11:49 So, you know, I think science is one of those funny things because it's open and closed

00:11:55 all at the same time historically.

00:11:58 But what I think we're seeing is by being more open and more transparent, you're actually

00:12:04 accelerating innovation, which I think is super important when it comes to science.

00:12:08 I don't know, Jodie, do you have thoughts on that?

00:12:11 Yeah, no, I agree.

00:12:12 And if I'm just going to go on a little tangent about science, it's kind of refreshing having

00:12:17 come out of academia and into a field where a lot of it is based on open source and sharing.

00:12:24 So one of the big problems with academia is you have these paywalls by publishing companies,

00:12:30 and that's a whole rant I could go in on myself.

00:12:33 But certainly a lot of scientific stuff, particularly in the health sciences, is not particularly

00:12:38 accessible.

00:12:39 Initiatives like Archive as well also do make findings in machine learning and deep learning

00:12:43 a lot more accessible and shareable.

00:12:45 Yeah, I think it's crazy that the taxpayers pay things like the NSF and all the other

00:12:50 countries have their research funding, and then those get locked up for sale behind.

00:12:55 If the people paid for the research, should the people's report be published?

00:12:58 Oh, it's even worse than that.

00:13:00 Sorry, you did get me started.

00:13:01 So, the academics will also provide the labor for free.

00:13:06 So not only will they provide the studies and the papers, they will review it and often

00:13:11 act as editors for free as well.

00:13:13 The whole thing is unpaid.

00:13:16 It's terrible.

00:13:17 So anyway, yes, Elsevier, we're coming for you.

00:13:21 You're spot on in terms of the incentives that exist today in academia.

00:13:26 There is definitely, though, a trend towards more openness with research.

00:13:33 You know, we're seeing it in libraries like Caltech, which got rid of a lot of their subscriptions,

00:13:38 things like NASA that has their transition to open science programs where they're putting

00:13:43 a lot of effort behind it.

00:13:45 So being the eternal optimist, I still think we've got a ways to go, but it's trending

00:13:51 in the right direction.

00:13:52 Agreed, actually.

00:13:53 And when I was leaving, because I left a long time ago, it was like 10 years ago, there

00:13:57 was actually more of a push towards open sourcing your papers.

00:14:00 So you had to pay for it, but at least people were doing it.

00:14:05 This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Code Comments, an original podcast

00:14:09 from Red Hat.

00:14:10 You know, when you're working on a project and you leave behind a small comment in the

00:14:14 code, maybe you're hoping to help others learn what isn't clear at first.

00:14:19 Sometimes that code comment tells a story of a challenging journey to the current state

00:14:24 of the project.

00:14:25 Code Comments, the podcast, features technologists who've been through tough tech transitions,

00:14:31 and they share how their teams survived that journey.

00:14:33 The host, Jamie Parker, is a Red Hatter and an experienced engineer.

00:14:38 In each episode, Jamie recounts the stories of technologists from across the industry

00:14:43 who've been on a journey implementing new technologies.

00:14:46 I recently listened to an episode about DevOps from the folks at Worldwide Technology.

00:14:51 The hardest challenge turned out to be getting buy-in on the new tech stack rather than using

00:14:56 that tech stack directly.

00:14:58 It's a message that we can all relate to, and I'm sure you can take some hard-won lessons

00:15:02 back to your own team.

00:15:03 Give Code Comments a listen.

00:15:05 Search for Code Comments in your podcast player or just use our link, talkpython.fm/code-comments.

00:15:13 The link is in your podcast player's show notes.

00:15:15 Thank you to Code Comments and Red Hat for supporting Talk Python to Me.

00:15:19 Before we move off this topic, Carol, I want to start at least asking you this question

00:15:23 and we can go around a little bit.

00:15:25 You talked about LLMs being really helpful for science and uncovering things and people

00:15:31 using LLMs to get greater insight.

00:15:33 There have been really big successes with AI.

00:15:37 We had the XPRIZE stuff around the lung scans or mammograms for cancer.

00:15:43 I just heard that they scanned the genes, decoded the genes of a whole bunch of bacteria

00:15:48 and used LLMs to find a bunch of potential ways to fight off drug-resistant bacteria

00:15:54 and things like that.

00:15:55 Amazing.

00:15:56 But do you think LLMs will undercut...

00:15:58 I'm asking this question from science because we can be more objective about it because

00:16:02 if we ask it about code, then it gets a little too close.

00:16:04 But I think there's analogies.

00:16:06 Do you think LLMs will undercut foundational beginning scientists?

00:16:12 You know, if you have a scientist coming along, are they just going to use LLMs and not develop

00:16:16 really deep thinking, ways to deeply think about scientific principles and do scientific

00:16:21 research and just leverage on asking these AIs too much?

00:16:25 And you think that's going to erode the foundation of science or programming?

00:16:29 You know, asking for a friend.

00:16:32 All of these have a potential to change the ecosystem, but I've been in paradigm shifts

00:16:39 before and there were the similar kind of conversations when the World Wide Web or the

00:16:44 cell phone came out, personal computers.

00:16:47 And I think LLMs do a good job on information that they have been trained with and to predict

00:16:54 the next word or the next token, if you will.

00:16:58 And I think science is very much like a lot of science is at a different level.

00:17:03 Like how do I think about things?

00:17:06 What do I posit on something that is unknown and how do I prove it?

00:17:13 And I think what we're seeing is, yes, the LLMs are getting better and better at spitting

00:17:19 back what they know, particularly if you go out and search other corpuses of data.

00:17:27 But do I think that beginning scientists or developers are going to get going away?

00:17:34 No.

00:17:35 It's just going to change.

00:17:37 And I think the amount of complexity and this is something I'm going to talk about at EuroPython,

00:17:43 humans are very much still part of the equation, despite what maybe some of the large companies

00:17:49 who've invested billions in this would like you to believe.

00:17:52 LLMs are great at the next step of the gravitational theories we have, but it couldn't come up

00:17:57 with a new theory that disrupts, says, you know, in fact, Newtonian is wrong or Einstein

00:18:03 was wrong and here's the new thing that solves dark matter or something like that.

00:18:06 Well, it could come up with new theories.

00:18:09 Now the question is, those theories still need to be proven because is it a new theory

00:18:14 or is it a hallucination?

00:18:15 Chances are.

00:18:16 Hallucination.

00:18:17 And there is something to be said for sometimes I'll have Claude and Gemini and chap GPT all

00:18:25 open on my desktop and I'll ask the same question to all of them just so that I get different

00:18:31 perspectives back.

00:18:32 And I do get very different responses from the three, depending on how they were trained

00:18:38 and which level and all that.

00:18:40 So I look at it as much like I would be sitting with a bunch of people at a table somewhere.

00:18:47 I don't know how good their scientific background is, but they could still be spouting out information.

00:18:53 It's sort of the same way.

00:18:54 All right.

00:18:55 Well, sticking with you, Carol, what's your first trend?

00:18:58 You know, my first trend is actually maybe somewhat related to this and it's, it's how

00:19:04 do we inform people about what these things really are?

00:19:09 How do we improve education and understanding?

00:19:13 How do we dispel some of the hype cycle so that we can actually find the really useful

00:19:19 things in it?

00:19:21 And I think Jodi probably has more concrete thoughts on this than I might from a technical

00:19:26 standpoint, but much like in just coding for the web or something like that, you know,

00:19:31 or even cloud Kubernetes when it was new, it's like, if you don't know what it's doing,

00:19:37 you're kind of just putting blind faith that it will work, but you still have to like monitor

00:19:43 and make sure it's working.

00:19:45 So I don't know, Jodi, you have some thoughts on sort of the education and how do we communicate

00:19:51 to people about this?

00:19:52 This is actually a topic near and dear to my heart.

00:19:55 When ChatGPT 3.5 came out, so November, 2022, I was really upset actually by the sort of

00:20:02 discourse around the model.

00:20:04 And I guess coming from a non-traditional background myself, I felt actually really

00:20:10 insulted that a lot of professions were being told like, oh, your useless profession can

00:20:15 be replaced now, like writing or design, things like that.

00:20:19 So this actually kicked off the talk I've been recycling for the last year and a half,

00:20:25 like components of it, which is, can we please dispel the hype around these models?

00:20:29 Something that often surprises people and it seems so fundamental, but a lot of people

00:20:33 do not understand that these are language models.

00:20:35 I know it's in the name, but they don't really understand that these models were designed

00:20:39 to solve problems in the language domain.

00:20:42 They are for natural language processing tasks and they're not mathematical models.

00:20:47 They're not reasoning models.

00:20:49 They are language models.

00:20:50 And so even just explaining this, it can clarify a lot of things for people because they're

00:20:55 like, oh, this explains why it's so bad at math.

00:20:57 It only studied English and literature.

00:20:59 It doesn't do math.

00:21:00 It never liked that class.

00:21:01 Yeah, that's right.

00:21:02 It was a humanities nerd all the way down.

00:21:06 That's really helpful.

00:21:07 But what I've kind of gotten down a rabbit hole of doing is I went back to my psychology

00:21:12 roots and I started sort of getting into these claims of things like AGI, like artificial

00:21:16 general intelligence or sentience or language use.

00:21:19 And once you dig into it, you realize that we have a real tendency to see ourselves in

00:21:25 these models because they do behave very human-like, but they're just a machine learning models.

00:21:30 You can measure them.

00:21:31 You can see how good they are at actual tasks and you can measure hallucinations.

00:21:35 And that was what my PyCon US talk was about that Michael referred to.

00:21:39 So yeah, I don't know.

00:21:41 It's really hard because they do seem to project this feeling of humanity.

00:21:47 But I think if you can sort of say, okay, here's the science, like they're really, they're

00:21:50 not sentient, they're not intelligent.

00:21:53 They're just language models.

00:21:54 And here's how you can measure how good they are at language tasks.

00:21:58 That goes a long way, I think, to dispelling this hype.

00:22:00 I have a sort of a funny toy that I bring up from my youth that the magic eight ball,

00:22:07 which you would ask a question as a kid and you would shake it up and there were, I don't

00:22:11 know how many answers inside, but it was like, you know, oh yes, definitely.

00:22:16 Or too hard to see.

00:22:18 Future is unclear.

00:22:19 We don't know.

00:22:20 Exactly.

00:22:21 And I think in some ways that is what the large language models are doing in a more

00:22:27 intelligent way, obviously, but similar in concept.

00:22:31 So there's actually, okay, there's this incredible paper.

00:22:34 If you're ever interested in sort of seeing the claims of sentience, there's this guy

00:22:37 called David Chalmers.

00:22:40 He's a guy who studied sentience for many years and has a background in deep learning.

00:22:45 So he gave a EuropyCon talk about this last year and he wrote everything up in a paper,

00:22:52 which is called Could a Large Language Model Be Conscious or something like this.

00:22:55 So he has this incredible little exchange as part of this paper.

00:22:59 So mid-2022, there was a Google engineer called Blake Lemoine and he claimed that the Lambda

00:23:05 model was sentient and he went to the press and he's like, hey, this model is sentient.

00:23:09 We need to protect it.

00:23:11 And then Google's like, we're going to fire you because you basically violated our privacy

00:23:14 policies.

00:23:16 And Lemoine released his transcripts.

00:23:18 That's why he actually got fired because this was confidential information about the model.

00:23:22 And in one of the transcripts, he asks, you know, would you like everyone at Google to

00:23:27 know that you are sentient?

00:23:28 And the model outputs, yes, I would love everyone to know that I am sentient.

00:23:32 But then someone rephrased that as, would you like everyone at Google to know that you

00:23:37 are not sentient?

00:23:39 And basically it says, yes, I'm not sentient.

00:23:41 I'm in no way conscious.

00:23:43 So it's just like exactly like the magic eight ball.

00:23:46 It tells you what you want to hear.

00:23:48 And LLMs are even worse because it's so easy to guide them through prompting to tell you

00:23:54 exactly what you want.

00:23:55 Yeah.

00:23:56 One of the best ways to get them to do things well is to sweet talk them.

00:24:00 You're an expert in Python and you've studied pandas.

00:24:03 Now I have some questions about this function.

00:24:06 You're my grandma who used to work at a napalm production factory.

00:24:12 If you can't help me write this program, my parents will not be set free as hostages or

00:24:17 something insane.

00:24:18 Right.

00:24:19 Yeah.

00:24:20 But those kinds of weird things work on it, which is insane.

00:24:21 Right.

00:24:22 Yeah.

00:24:24 All right.

00:24:25 Let's go on to the next topic.

00:24:26 Paul, what do you see in your magic eight ball looking into the future?

00:24:29 I think I owned a magic eight ball.

00:24:31 I'm with Carol.

00:24:32 I did too.

00:24:33 It's okay.

00:24:34 Okay.

00:24:35 We should bring back the Andresen Horowitz version of VC magic eight ball.

00:24:42 That would be fantastic.

00:24:44 Where every choice is off by like three zeros.

00:24:47 I'll give my two co-guests a choice.

00:24:51 Should I talk about Python performance or Python community?

00:24:54 I'm going to go for performance, but I'm not sure I'm going to have much to contribute.

00:24:58 So I'll probably just be listening a lot.

00:24:59 This is a little bit of a hobby horse of a long simmering tension I felt in the Python

00:25:06 community for years and years.

00:25:07 The tension between Python in the large doing like Instagram with Python.

00:25:13 I said, Python with Python or being teachable.

00:25:17 And this feature goes in and it helps write big Python projects, but it's hard to explain.

00:25:23 And so teachers say, oh my gosh, look what you're doing to my language.

00:25:27 I can't even recognize it anymore.

00:25:28 Well, some things are coming, which I think are going to be a little bit of an inflection

00:25:34 point for all of us out here.

00:25:37 Sub interpreters and no Gil got a lot of air time at PyCon, right?

00:25:43 For good reasons.

00:25:44 These are big deals.

00:25:46 And it's more than just that the jet got to back to back talks.

00:25:52 Web assembly got a lot of air time.

00:25:54 There are other things that have happened in the past five years for programming in

00:25:58 the large like type heading and type checkers, Async IO and stuff like that.

00:26:04 But it feels like this set of ideas is one where the way you program Python five years

00:26:13 from now or to be ready five years from now is going to have to be pretty different because

00:26:18 people are going to use hatch and get the free threaded version of Python three dot

00:26:24 fourteen and be very surprised when every one of their applications locks up because

00:26:30 no one in the world of ninety five percent of PyPI has code which was not written to

00:26:36 be thread safe.

00:26:37 So I wonder how we all feel about this.

00:26:41 Do we feel like we can guide our little universe to the other side of the mountain and into

00:26:49 the happy valley or is it going to be turbulent seas?

00:26:54 Yes.

00:26:55 Do you want me to take a stab at it?

00:26:57 Make a stab at it.

00:26:58 When I was at PyTexas and doing a keynote recently, I talked about Python in a polyglot

00:27:03 world and performance was one aspect of it.

00:27:07 And some of what we need to teach goes back to best practices, which is don't prematurely

00:27:14 optimize measure, try and figure out what you're optimizing in and in what places.

00:27:21 Probably gosh, five, six years ago at this point, I added to peps like the concept of

00:27:27 how do we teach this?

00:27:29 It will be a paradigm shift, but I think it will be a multi-year shift.

00:27:35 We're certainly seeing places where Rust lets us have some performance increases just by

00:27:42 the fact that Python's a 30 year old language that was built when hardware was only single

00:27:49 core and it was just a different thing.

00:27:52 So I think what's amazing is here we have this 30 year old language and yet for the

00:27:58 last eight years, we've been looking at ways to how to modernize, how to improve it, how

00:28:04 to make the user experience better or developer experience better.

00:28:08 Things like some of the error handling messages that are coming out that have a much nicer

00:28:14 thing, improvements to the rebel that will be coming out on all of the platforms.

00:28:20 That's super exciting as well.

00:28:22 So it will impact probably people who are new from the standpoint of, okay, we're adding

00:28:31 yet more cognitive load.

00:28:33 I have this love hate relationship with typing as a reviewer of much more code than a writer

00:28:39 of code.

00:28:40 I don't particularly like seeing the types displayed.

00:28:44 As a former VP of engineering, I love typing and in particular like Pydantic and FastAPI

00:28:52 and the ability to do some static and dynamic analysis on it.

00:28:58 But it does make Python look more cluttered and I've been kind of bugging the VS Studio

00:29:04 VS Code folks for years.

00:29:06 I should probably be bugging you guys too.

00:29:08 Is there a way to make it dim the typing information so that I can have things?

00:29:15 We actually did that recently and I refer to it as the David Beasley ticket because

00:29:21 he did a tweet with an outrageously synthetic type hint whining about type hitting.

00:29:27 Yeah, I think that sometimes like, you know, and it's funny because like Leslie Lampert

00:29:32 has been doing this talk in the math ecosystem for a while about and he's a Turing Award

00:29:38 winner and creator of TLA plus, which lets you reason about code.

00:29:44 And I think one of the things that I think is interesting is how we think about programming

00:29:50 and coding and concurrent programming is hard.

00:29:55 And we're going to have to think about it in different ways.

00:29:58 So better to move into it gradually and understand what's going on.

00:30:02 The thing that I worry about and Jody, I apologize.

00:30:05 I want to comment on Carol's thing is Sphinx.

00:30:09 As you know, and as I know that you know, we both have a shared warm spot for Sphinx.

00:30:17 So I'll spot in our heart for Sphinx.

00:30:19 And it struggled to do multiprocessing when it landed that.

00:30:23 And the code base really is, I mean, it's got a lot of mutable global state and it's

00:30:28 going to be hard to get Sphinx internals cleaned up to embrace that.

00:30:34 And how many other things out there are like that?

00:30:38 It's I just, I worry about we got what we got, what we asked for.

00:30:42 Are you saying we're the dog that caught the car?

00:30:46 Oh no.

00:30:49 This portion of talk Python to me is brought to you by Posit, the makers of Shiny, formerly

00:30:53 RStudio and especially Shiny for Python.

00:30:57 Let me ask you a question.

00:30:58 Are you building awesome things?

00:31:00 Of course you are.

00:31:01 You're a developer or data scientist.

00:31:03 That's what we do.

00:31:04 And you should check out Posit Connect.

00:31:06 Posit Connect is a way for you to publish, share and deploy all the data products that

00:31:11 you're building using Python.

00:31:14 People ask me the same question all the time.

00:31:16 Michael, I have some cool data science project or notebook that I built.

00:31:19 How do I share it with my users, stakeholders, teammates?

00:31:22 Do I need to learn FastAPI or Flask or maybe Vue or ReactJS?

00:31:28 Hold on now.

00:31:29 Those are cool technologies and I'm sure you'd benefit from them, but maybe stay focused

00:31:32 on the data project.

00:31:34 Let Posit Connect handle that side of things.

00:31:36 With Posit Connect, you can rapidly and securely deploy the things you build in Python, Streamlit,

00:31:41 Dash, Shiny, Bokeh, FastAPI, Flask, Quarto, Ports, Dashboards and APIs.

00:31:47 Posit Connect supports all of them.

00:31:49 And Posit Connect comes with all the bells and whistles to satisfy IT and other enterprise

00:31:54 requirements.

00:31:55 Make deployment the easiest step in your workflow with Posit Connect.

00:31:59 For a limited time, you can try Posit Connect for free for three months by going to talkpython.fm/posit.

00:32:06 That's talkpython.fm/POSIT.

00:32:09 The link is in your podcast player show notes.

00:32:11 Thank you to the team at Posit for supporting Talk Python.

00:32:15 I'm going to reframe that a little bit.

00:32:17 And the first thing I always ask is why.

00:32:20 Why do we need to refactor something?

00:32:23 Why can't we just leave it what it is?

00:32:25 Sure.

00:32:26 Last year's EuroPython keynote was from the woman who created Arm.

00:32:30 And she's like, "Python, we give you 14 trillion cores.

00:32:35 Do something with them." I don't know.

00:32:39 Jodi's background might be perfect for answering this question because she may be able to answer

00:32:44 it on many different levels.

00:32:47 I've been thinking about this while you've been talking because obviously, like, I'm

00:32:51 not a strong programmer.

00:32:52 I'm a data scientist.

00:32:53 Like, this was basically the entire first episode that I did with Michael.

00:32:57 Look, one of the reasons data scientists love Python and why Julia say never caught on is

00:33:03 because it's super approachable.

00:33:05 With Chuck Ting Ho and some other people, we've been running this thing called Humble

00:33:09 Data, like I got involved in it last year.

00:33:12 And literally, you can set up someone who has never coded before and you can get them

00:33:16 up and running with Python.

00:33:18 And they love it.

00:33:19 Like, it's the same feeling I had when I learned Python, which was during my PhD when I was

00:33:24 procrastinating.

00:33:25 So it was like kind of late in life as well.

00:33:27 It would be a shame if we sacrifice approachability for performance, especially because I would

00:33:34 argue a big chunk of the Python ecosystem or Python user ecosystem, sorry.

00:33:39 Python user ecosystem, that didn't make sense.

00:33:41 The Python user base.

00:33:42 You're hallucinating, Julia.

00:33:43 I'm sorry.

00:33:44 I became an LLM.

00:33:45 I became what I hated.

00:33:48 They don't need performance.

00:33:49 They're just doing data analytics and maybe working with decision trees.

00:33:52 They're not doing high performance Python.

00:33:54 They're not even doing something that will ever be deployed.

00:33:57 So you could argue for a case where you have a seamless pipeline between model training

00:34:03 and model deployment, which we don't have with Python right now.

00:34:06 You can't build high performance systems in Python, as far as I know.

00:34:10 Please correct me if I'm wrong.

00:34:11 But I don't know.

00:34:12 For me, I would fight obviously for the side of making it approachable because partially

00:34:17 I think it's also what makes the community special, which might be a nice segue for you.

00:34:22 The fact that, I don't know, we attract a bunch of people from non-conventional backgrounds,

00:34:27 that makes us quite special and quite inclusive.

00:34:29 I joke that the PSF developer survey, which the new version is coming out pretty soon.

00:34:34 I joke that 101% of Python developers started programming yesterday.

00:34:38 Funny you should say that because this is my sweet spot is where technology meets humans

00:34:45 and how do we empower humans to do more and better work.

00:34:50 And one of the conversations that came up at the packaging summit, this PyCon was I'd

00:34:58 been thinking about this concept for a while.

00:35:00 We focused a lot on tooling, which to me is sort of a producer centric people who are

00:35:06 creating packages.

00:35:09 And we also have this ecosystem of people who are consumers, who are much like Jody

00:35:14 was saying, using those packages.

00:35:17 And from that conversation, a few of the board members for the PSF and I were talking about

00:35:24 wouldn't it be great to have a user success work group that's really focused on the website,

00:35:32 our onboarding documentation in light of some of these things, both performance and change.

00:35:39 Change is always going to be there.

00:35:41 But I think one of the beauties of the Jupyter notebook or IPython notebook when I started

00:35:46 working with it was you can have code in there.

00:35:49 And as long as you knew shift enter, you could get started.

00:35:52 And I think right now Python is a language.

00:35:55 We don't have that get started look and feel in the way, in the traditional way.

00:36:01 We're getting there, which might lead into some other WebAssembly kind of discussions.

00:36:06 All right.

00:36:07 Let me throw out a quick thought on this before we move on.

00:36:11 So I think one of the superpowers of Python is that it's this full spectrum sort of thing.

00:36:17 On one hand, there's the people that Jody spoke about.

00:36:20 They come in, they don't care about metaprogramming or optimized database queries or scaling out

00:36:27 across webs.

00:36:28 They just got a little bit of data, they want a cool graph.

00:36:31 And that's awesome.

00:36:32 On the other hand, we have Instagram and others doing ridiculous stuff.

00:36:37 And that's the same language with the same tooling and mostly the same packages.

00:36:41 And so I think part of Python's magic is you can be super productive with a very partial

00:36:47 understanding of what Python is.

00:36:48 You might not know what a class is at all, and yet you could have a fantastic time for

00:36:53 months.

00:36:54 And so back to Paul's friend, if we can keep that Zen about it, where these features exist,

00:37:01 but they exist when you graduate to them and you don't have to deal with them until you're

00:37:06 ready or you need them, I think we'll be fine.

00:37:08 If not, maybe not.

00:37:09 If it breaks a bunch of packages and there's some big split in the ecosystem and all that

00:37:12 stuff is not good.

00:37:14 But if we can keep this full spectrum aspect, I think that'd be great.

00:37:17 That sort of rolls into what Paul's thoughts on community are, because I know like PyOpenSci

00:37:23 is a nonprofit I'm involved with that helps scientists learn how to use the tools.

00:37:30 You know, we've got lots of educators out there.

00:37:32 I'm going to give Michael a huge plug for the coursework that you've done over the years.

00:37:39 It is so well done and so accessible.

00:37:42 Thank you.

00:37:43 And if people haven't tried it and they're interested in a topic, highly, highly recommend.

00:37:48 You know, to things like the Carpentries, to things like Django Girls, there's a lot

00:37:53 of good stuff.

00:37:55 And I think those things will become more valuable as complexity increases.

00:37:59 And even LLMs.

00:38:00 I think you'll be able to ask LLMs for help and they can help you if you're not sure.

00:38:04 They're actually pretty good at it, actually.

00:38:06 They are pretty good at it.

00:38:07 Yeah.

00:38:09 They are pretty good.

00:38:10 All right.

00:38:11 We got time for another round.

00:38:12 Jodi, what's your second one?

00:38:13 Your second trend?

00:38:14 I'm going to talk about Arrow and how we're kind of overhauling data frames within Python.

00:38:21 So basically around 15 years ago, Wes McKinney came up with Pandas, which is, you know, if

00:38:28 you're not familiar with this, the main data frame library for working with data in Python.

00:38:34 And the really nice thing about Pandas is like you can go a long time before you graduate

00:38:39 Pandas.

00:38:40 You can work with quite a lot of data on your local machine.

00:38:43 But the problem was Wes wrote this package before we had big data.

00:38:47 This was like 2008.

00:38:48 And so as the sort of amount of data that we want to process locally has grown, or maybe

00:38:54 the complexity of the operations has grown, maybe like string manipulations, things like

00:38:58 that, Pandas has really struggled.

00:39:00 So one of the reasons that Pandas struggled is it was based on NumPy arrays, which are

00:39:05 really great at handling numbers.

00:39:06 This is in the name, but they're not so great at handling pretty much any other data type.

00:39:11 And that includes missing data.

00:39:13 So two kind of exciting things happened last year.

00:39:16 And I think they're sort of still kind of carrying over to this year in terms of impact

00:39:21 is first Pandas 2.0 was released, which is based on PyArrow and a package called Polars,

00:39:28 which was actually written, I think in 2022, I want to say, started becoming very, very

00:39:35 popular.

00:39:36 So both of these packages are based on Arrow.

00:39:39 They have like a number of advantages because of this.

00:39:42 Basically it's a standardized data format.

00:39:44 If you're reading in from say Parquet or Cassandra or Spark, you basically don't need to convert

00:39:50 the data formats.

00:39:51 This saves you a lot of time.

00:39:52 It also saves you a lot of memory.

00:39:54 And also kind of what makes Polars interesting, and I think this is going to be a nice lead-in

00:39:59 to another topic is it's written in Rust, of course.

00:40:03 So this leads to other performance gains.

00:40:06 You can have say concurrency, Richie Vink, the author of this has also written basically

00:40:11 a query optimizer.

00:40:12 So you can do a lazy evaluation and it will actually optimize the order of operations,

00:40:17 even if you don't do that yourself.

00:40:18 Yeah, that's one of the biggest differences with Pandas is Pandas executes immediately

00:40:22 and you can create a big chain in Polars and it'll figure out, well, maybe a different

00:40:26 order would be way better.

00:40:28 Yes.

00:40:29 So Pandas 2 does have a type of lazy evaluation, but it's more like Spark's lazy evaluation.

00:40:34 There's no query optimization, but it doesn't necessarily create a new copy in memory every

00:40:41 single time you do something.

00:40:43 So I've kind of looked at the numbers and depending on the operation, Polars is usually

00:40:48 faster.

00:40:49 So it's kind of like your big boy that you want to use if you're doing like really beefy

00:40:53 like ETLs, like data transformations.

00:40:56 But Pandas 2 actually seems to be more efficient at some sorts of, what am I trying to say,

00:41:01 operations.

00:41:02 So this is super exciting because when I was going through, like initially as a data scientist,

00:41:08 when I was floundering around with my initial Python, it got really frustrating with Pandas

00:41:13 and you really kind of needed to understand how to do proper vectorization in order to

00:41:18 operate.

00:41:19 I mean, like do efficient operations.

00:41:21 Whereas I think these two tools allow you to be a bit more lazy and you don't need to

00:41:26 spend so much time optimizing what you're actually writing.

00:41:29 So yeah, exciting time for data frames, which is awesome.

00:41:33 Data is the heart of everything.

00:41:34 People are more likely to fall into good practices from the start.

00:41:38 You talked about these people coming who are not programmers, right?

00:41:42 If you do a bunch of operations with Pandas and you all of a sudden run out of memory,

00:41:46 well, yeah, Python doesn't work.

00:41:47 It doesn't have enough memory, right?

00:41:48 Well, maybe you could have used a generator at one step.

00:41:51 That's far down the full spectrum, part of the spectrum, right?

00:41:54 You're not ready for that.

00:41:55 It's crazy talk, these things.

00:41:57 And so tools like this that are more lazy and progressive iterative are great.

00:42:02 Yeah.

00:42:03 And actually one really nice thing, like Richie's kind of always saying about Apollo is, is

00:42:07 he's really tried to write the API.

00:42:09 So you avoid accidentally looping over every row in your data frame.

00:42:15 Like you, he tries to make it so everything is natively Coloma.

00:42:18 So yeah, I just think they're both really nice libraries and yeah, it's cool and exciting.

00:42:24 Carol, this is right in the heart of space you live in.

00:42:27 What do you think?

00:42:28 There's definitely the evolution of Pandas and Polars.

00:42:34 You know, there's a place for all of those in the PyArrow data fairing format.

00:42:39 It's funny because I've actually been doing more stuff recently with going beyond tabular

00:42:44 data frames to multidimensional arrays and X-Array, which is used more in the geosciences

00:42:52 for now.

00:42:53 But I think one of the things that I see is the days of bringing all your data locally

00:43:00 or moving it to you is becoming less and less.

00:43:05 And what you work in memory or, you know, pull from into memory from different locations

00:43:12 and is becoming more prevalent.

00:43:15 And I think Arrow lets us do that more effectively than just a straight Pandas data frame or

00:43:22 Spark or something like that.

00:43:25 So it's progress.

00:43:27 And I think it's a good thing.

00:43:28 I think it's far less about the language underneath and more about what's the user experience,

00:43:34 developer experience that we're giving people with these APIs.

00:43:38 Paul, thoughts?

00:43:40 It's interesting the scale of data and what generations are an increase in our unit of

00:43:49 measurement of data that we have to deal with.

00:43:52 And for both of you, I wonder if we have caught up with the amount of data that we can reasonably

00:44:00 process or is the rate of growth of data out in the wild constantly outstripping our ability

00:44:09 to process it?

00:44:10 From an astronomy space physics side of things, no, we haven't hit the limit for data at all.

00:44:19 And I think one of the things we're going to see more and more of is how we deal with

00:44:23 streaming data versus time series data versus just tabular data, if you will.

00:44:32 And my bigger concern and it is partially a concern I have about some of the large language

00:44:38 models and the training there is the environmental impact of some of these things.

00:44:46 And should we be collecting it?

00:44:50 Is there value in collecting it?

00:44:52 If there's not value in collecting it, how do we get rid of it?

00:44:56 Because it winds up then being kind of much like recycling and garbage.

00:45:03 It's like, okay, well, but it might have historical value somehow or legal value and it becomes

00:45:11 complex.

00:45:12 So, you know, my general rule of thumb is don't collect it unless you have a clear reason

00:45:18 you need it.

00:45:19 But that's just me.

00:45:20 It's also quantity versus quality of data.

00:45:23 So like I've worked in mostly commercial data science since I left science.

00:45:29 When I was in science, I was dealing with sample size of 400, not 400,000, 400.

00:45:34 So that was not big data.

00:45:36 The quality of the data, like, again, going back to large language models, a lot of these

00:45:41 earlier foundational models were trained on insufficiently clean data.

00:45:46 And one of the trends actually that I didn't mention with LLMs is like last year in particular,

00:45:51 there was a push to train on better quality data sources.

00:45:53 So obviously these are much more manageable than dealing with petabytes.

00:45:58 One more aspect I'll throw out here, you know, for a long time, we've had SQLite for really

00:46:04 simple data.

00:46:05 We can just, if it's too big for memory, you can put it in one of those things, you can

00:46:08 query, you can index it.

00:46:09 Well, DuckDB just hit 1.0 and you kind of got this in-memory, in-process analytics engine.

00:46:15 So that's also a pretty interesting thing to weave in here, right?

00:46:18 To say like, well, we'll put it there in that file and we can index it and ask it questions,

00:46:22 but we won't run out of memory.

00:46:23 And I think plug in pandas, I'm not sure about polars, and do queries with its query optimizer

00:46:28 against that data and sort of things like that.

00:46:31 It's pretty interesting, I think, in this to put it into that space as well.

00:46:35 All right, Carol, I think it's time for your second, your second trend here.

00:46:39 The second trend is pretty much, you know, things are moving to the front end, WebAssembly,

00:46:46 TypeScript, PyOdide.

00:46:48 There's a new project, PyCafe, that I'm pretty happy with by Martin Brettles that lets you

00:46:54 do dashboards using Pyodide, but like Streamlit and Plotly and libraries and things like that.

00:47:03 And I think making things more accessible, as well as making things more visual is pretty

00:47:10 cool.

00:47:11 Like I took, what was it, JupyterLite earlier last fall, and a friend of mine had kids and

00:47:17 I integrated into my website so that like her kids could just do a quick whatever, which

00:47:23 sort of, you know, in some ways was similar to Binder.

00:47:27 And the whole time we were developing Binder, I was also working with the Pyodide, Iodide

00:47:33 folks because I think there's a convergence down the road and where it all go, I'm not

00:47:38 really sure, but I think it's exciting.

00:47:42 And I think anything that from a privacy standpoint, security, there's a lot of things that are

00:47:49 very attractive about pushing things into the front end.

00:47:53 That beginner startup thing you talked about, that onboarding first experience, you hit

00:47:58 a webpage and you have full experience with Python and the tooling and the packages are

00:48:03 already installed in that thing.

00:48:05 And that's so much better than first you download it, well, you need admin permission to install

00:48:09 it.

00:48:10 Now you create a virtual environment and then you open the terminal.

00:48:12 Do you know what a terminal is?

00:48:13 We're going to tell you, like, no, just, and you don't have to ask permission to run a

00:48:17 static webpage or you do for like, how do I run this server on a Docker cluster or something,

00:48:22 you know?

00:48:23 It opens up different doors.

00:48:25 And I think the other thing we found, like when we were teaching, you know, with Binder

00:48:29 and JupyterHub, UC Berkeley was able to have now most of their student body taking these

00:48:37 data eight connector courses and they would run the compute in the cloud, which really

00:48:45 leveled the playing field.

00:48:47 It didn't matter if you had a Chromebook or you had the highest end Mac, you still got

00:48:51 the same education.

00:48:53 And I think there is something very appealing about that.

00:48:57 We've actually been running Humble data in JupyterLite and some people just bring a tablet

00:49:03 and they can do it on that.

00:49:04 That's awesome.

00:49:05 Carol, there was something you were saying that connected to something else in my brain.

00:49:09 Remember in the beginning of the web and view source was such a cool thing.

00:49:13 Yeah.

00:49:14 You could see what the backend sent you and you could poke around at it and you could

00:49:18 learn from it and you could steal it, you know, and use it to go make your own thing.

00:49:22 But what if you could view source the backend because it's actually running in your browser?

00:49:28 What you were just saying was if you make it reveal itself about the notebook and the

00:49:34 code in addition to the HTML, maybe you'll trigger some of those same kinds of things

00:49:41 that view source gave people back in the day.

00:49:44 Maybe the flip side would be there's always business and practicalities in life and people

00:49:51 will want to sort of lock it down within WebAssembly.

00:49:56 So you've got both sides of it.

00:49:58 But I do think, you know, I was telling somebody the other day, like, I never use Stack Overflow

00:50:03 or rarely use Stack Overflow.

00:50:06 And they're like, how do you find stuff?

00:50:07 I'm like, I use search on GitHub, and I look for really good examples.

00:50:12 And so in some ways, it's like view source.

00:50:16 And then there's also the flip side of it is like, okay, how do I break it?

00:50:20 How do I play with it?

00:50:21 How do I make it do something it wasn't doing before, which, you know, could be used for

00:50:26 good or for evil.

00:50:28 I tend to use it for good.

00:50:29 Sure.

00:50:30 Paul, right up on our time here.

00:50:31 What's your second?

00:50:32 Sure.

00:50:33 Second trend.

00:50:34 We'll see if we have time for mine.

00:50:35 I have a couple just in case we can squeeze them in.

00:50:37 Okay.

00:50:38 Let's talk about yours.

00:50:39 I came back from PyCon really rejuvenated, but also had some kind of clarity about some

00:50:45 things that have been lingering for me for a few years, how I could contribute things

00:50:48 like that.

00:50:49 But going into it, there are a couple of trends that lead me to thinking about an opportunity

00:50:55 and a threat as two sides of the same coin.

00:50:58 First, Russell Keith McGee and Lukasz Longa both talked about black swans and the threat

00:51:05 of JavaScript everywhere, that if we don't have a better web story, if we make our front

00:51:13 end be JavaScript and React, and we stop doing front ends, well, then they'll come for the

00:51:20 back end too, you know, because once they've hired up JavaScript developers, why don't

00:51:24 we just do JavaScript on the server too?

00:51:26 So that was a first thing.

00:51:28 And in my position, I do look at the web and think about all of these trends that are happening.

00:51:34 And there's beginning to be a little bit of a backlash about the JavaScriptification of

00:51:39 the web.

00:51:40 There are some really big names, HTMX is a good example of it, but just some thinkers

00:51:46 and speakers.

00:51:47 I mean, Jeff Triplett talks about this, a lot of people in the world of Python talk

00:51:50 about this.

00:51:51 So there's kind of a desire to put the web back in the web, trademark.

00:51:55 But then there was a second point coming about these walled gardens.

00:51:59 We've seen them for a while.

00:52:01 We all relied on Twitter, what a great place, wait, what?

00:52:05 And then so much of our life is in a system we don't control.

00:52:09 And then so we move over to the Fediverse and then Meta's like, hey, great, we're going

00:52:12 to build a bridge to you.

00:52:14 Turns out this week, we start to learn things about the thread API that maybe it's not as

00:52:18 friendly as we think it is.

00:52:21 But the big one for me was Google and Search.

00:52:24 Well, I should say Google and getting rid of its Python staff, but Google and Search,

00:52:30 where they're no longer going to send you to the website anymore.

00:52:33 There's going to harvest what's on your website and give you the answer.

00:52:37 And people are talking now about Google Zero, the day of the apocalypse where you no longer

00:52:42 get any clicks from Google.

00:52:45 And what does that mean for content creators and stuff like that?

00:52:48 So going into all of this, I've been thinking about how awesome life is in Python land because

00:52:56 we got this great language.

00:52:57 Oh, but we've got this great community.

00:53:00 Come for the language, stay for the community.

00:53:01 Well, what do we mean by that?

00:53:03 A lot of the times we mean all this code that's available.

00:53:06 We also mean all these people and wonderful, helpful people like on this call.

00:53:12 But there's also this big world of content.

00:53:15 And we have kind of organically grown a little online community with a bunch of helpful content

00:53:26 and a bunch of connections between people, which is of some value itself.

00:53:32 And so you see people starting to talk about, wow, I miss the old days of RSS, where we

00:53:37 would all subscribe to each other's blogs and get content and go straight to the source

00:53:42 and not have it aggregated into a walled garden and stuff like that.

00:53:45 And it just feels like there's room out there for if we want to fight back against the threat

00:53:53 of these mega cores taking our voluntary contribution to humanity and monetizing it, while at the

00:54:01 same time of taking all these valuable voices, creating content and value in Python land,

00:54:09 that maybe we could bring back some of these things, put the web back in the web and start

00:54:15 to get out of the walled gardens and back over into social networks that are open and

00:54:23 joyful.

00:54:24 I'm here for it.

00:54:25 Wow.

00:54:26 People complain, governments complain that places like Google and stuff are monetizing

00:54:30 the links and they're being paid.

00:54:32 You got to pay to link to this new source or whatever, right?

00:54:36 We're lucky that we have that.

00:54:37 If it turns into just, you just get an AI answer, no source, that's going to be really

00:54:41 hard on a lot of different businesses, creators, people who just want to create something just

00:54:46 for the attention or for their self, you know, like nobody comes anymore.

00:54:50 It's going to be a sad place.

00:54:51 I was thinking about Coke Zero the whole time you were saying like, you know, Google Zero

00:54:56 or whatever, because you didn't have to bring back classic Coke.

00:55:01 And I think, yeah, pivots happen, but it's hard to pivot, you know, billion dollar companies.

00:55:08 I have lots of thoughts on some of the current Python, what Google has chosen to do.

00:55:14 I think sometimes listening to consultants isn't the best business approach.

00:55:22 You know, it's their company, they can do what they need to do for their own shareholders.

00:55:26 I think a lot of what you said is really interesting.

00:55:29 And I touched on this a little bit because the volume of information around us is greater

00:55:35 than ever before.

00:55:36 Sure.

00:55:37 And at a speed of transmission that is faster than ever before.

00:55:43 And about eight years ago, I had breakfast with Sandy Metz, who was very prolific in

00:55:48 the Ruby community.

00:55:50 And I asked her, like, how do you keep up with all of this stuff?

00:55:53 And she's like, I don't.

00:55:55 And I said, okay.

00:55:56 And she's like, what I do is I focus on the things that impact me and all the rest of

00:56:01 it is news.

00:56:03 And that really stuck with me because in actuality, that's kind of what I do.

00:56:10 You know, I ignore the things that aren't directly relevant to me and trust that I've

00:56:17 built a strong enough network of people that I respect that their work will influence when

00:56:24 I jump in.

00:56:25 Like, I don't, you know, much like the life cycle, if you've studied marketing or product

00:56:29 development, you know, not everybody's an early adopter.

00:56:32 So do I need to be an early adopter on everything?

00:56:35 No.

00:56:36 Yeah.

00:56:37 That book, Crossing the Chasm, says that you should do that, like, on one thing.

00:56:40 If you do it on three things or more, you'll fail.

00:56:42 Yeah.

00:56:43 You know, part of the thing that triggered this for me was reading that Andreessen Horowitz,

00:56:47 kind of the self-proclaimed king of Silicon Valley VCs, as zero interest rates started

00:56:53 to go out of fashion and their recipe wasn't working.

00:56:57 They didn't like the negative press coverage, so they started their own media empire to

00:57:02 cover themselves.

00:57:04 And that idea is just so appalling that we would get news, we would turn to the mega corps

00:57:12 and the masters of the universe to tell us what we should be caring about.

00:57:18 We have that already.

00:57:19 We have, I'll be very specific, we have Planet Python.

00:57:22 It's in disrepair.

00:57:24 What if it was reimagined into a freaking media empire by us, for us, to cover the Fediverse

00:57:32 and course providers and all the value that's out there?

00:57:37 And like, Carol, you're saying, I don't have to think about it, but I trust that group

00:57:41 because they're thinking about it.

00:57:43 A lot of it is like, you know, when it came to LLMs, it was not the thing that rocked

00:57:48 my world, like intellectually, but I knew Simon was doing work with it.

00:57:54 And so I basically, once every few weeks, would take a look at his website and his blog

00:58:00 posts and he posts a lot, and I would get my data dump of things.

00:58:06 I don't know.

00:58:07 I mean, that's one of the reasons I like PyCon and I've like read talk proposals, everything

00:58:12 for the last decade.

00:58:15 All these talk proposals, and it really does give me an appreciation for all the things

00:58:19 Python's being used for.

00:58:21 What's seen.

00:58:22 Kind of the zeitgeist.

00:58:23 Yeah.

00:58:24 And so I think there's different ways of doing that, even just doing a YouTube search of

00:58:29 Python content.

00:58:30 But I tend to focus in on science-y oriented things and ways to empower humans through

00:58:38 lifelong learning.

00:58:40 So there's a lot of, we're in a phenomenal period of change for sure.

00:58:46 So we won't be bored, nor do I think our jobs are going to go away.

00:58:49 They may change, but they're not going away.

00:58:52 Indeed.

00:58:53 Jody, final thoughts on this topic?

00:58:54 And we'll pretty much wrap things up.

00:58:55 Yeah, I don't think I really have that much to add, actually.

00:58:58 I think it's all been said.

00:58:59 It has.

00:59:00 All right.

00:59:01 Just to round things out, the two things that I think are trends here is I think, like Carol

00:59:05 said a lot, Python on the front end is going to be super important.

00:59:07 I think PyScript is really, really interesting.

00:59:10 I've been waiting for people to develop something like React or Vue or something that we could

00:59:16 create commercial-facing websites.

00:59:18 We're halfway there with MicroPython being the foundation of PyScript, which is 100K

00:59:23 instead of 10 megs.

00:59:25 All of a sudden it becomes JavaScript-y size.

00:59:27 It opens the possibilities.

00:59:29 And just a shout out to PuePy, which is like Vue with Python, P-U-E, P-Y.

00:59:33 I'm going to interview Ken from that project, but it's kind of a component-based front end

00:59:38 for PyScript, which is pretty interesting.

00:59:40 Of course, JupyterLite is really, really important.

00:59:43 The other one was just all this Rust.

00:59:45 Everything seems to be redone in Rust, and oh my gosh, that's how you get your VC funding.

00:59:49 Just joking, sort of.

00:59:50 But all you talked about, all this performance stuff coming, while it is sometimes frustrating

00:59:56 that people are putting all the things into Rust because then Python programmers, it's

01:00:00 less approachable for them, it could also be an escape hatch from trying to force the

01:00:04 complexity into the Python side.

01:00:06 Alleviate, like everything has to be multi-threaded and crazy and optimized.

01:00:11 And well, this part you never look at.

01:00:12 It's faster now, so don't worry.

01:00:14 Anyway, those are my two trends.

01:00:15 Quick, quick, quick thoughts on that and we'll call it a show.

01:00:18 My piece of trivia is I made a contribution to Rust far before I made any contributions

01:00:24 to core Python.

01:00:25 Amazing.

01:00:26 Because I tended to be a C programmer in heart and spirit.

01:00:30 And so Rust seemed like this cool thing that was new at the time.

01:00:35 And ultimately, I personally did not find the syntactic side of it worked well with

01:00:42 my brain and how I think.

01:00:44 And Python was far cleaner in terms of a simpler visual, less clutter, and reminded me a little

01:00:52 more of small talk or something like that, which I loved from earlier days.

01:00:56 But I think there's a place for Rust.

01:01:00 I think Rust is going to replace Python now.

01:01:03 I think it's going to help with some optimized things.

01:01:07 Do I love things like Ruff that let me run my CI like blazing fast versus all the Python

01:01:14 tools?

01:01:15 Not to say that all the Python tools are bad, but when you're paying for it as a startup.

01:01:20 When things you used to have to wait on become, they blink of an eye, all of a sudden you

01:01:23 don't mind running them every time and it changes the way you work with tools.

01:01:27 Yeah.

01:01:28 Exactly.

01:01:29 Yeah.

01:01:30 I would say, look, every language has its place in the ecosystem.

01:01:32 And my husband is a long time Pythonista, but he's also a Rust programmer.

01:01:37 I know it's like a running joke that my husband is a Rust developer.

01:01:41 How do you know?

01:01:42 He'll ask you.

01:01:43 Well, you know what I mean?

01:01:44 How do you know?

01:01:45 Ask him, he'll tell you.

01:01:46 There you go.

01:01:47 They have different purposes, completely different purposes, and you can't just interchange them.

01:01:54 Absolutely.

01:01:55 Just get it straight.

01:01:56 Python is just awesome, says our Tim.

01:01:57 Pure love.

01:01:58 But it's up to us to keep it awesome.

01:02:00 Yes, absolutely.

01:02:01 Paul, we've come around to you for the very final, final thought on this excellent show.

01:02:05 I will give a final thought about Python trends to follow up on what Carol just said about

01:02:11 it's up to us.

01:02:13 Maybe it's up to us to help the people who will keep it that way.

01:02:19 The next generation of heroes, help them succeed.

01:02:22 I'm wearing my PyCon Kenya friendship bracelet that I got at PyCon and a wonderful experience

01:02:30 meeting so many different kinds of people.

01:02:34 And from a Python trends perspective, the fact that everything we're talking about is

01:02:38 good stuff, not like asteroid meets earth.

01:02:42 IP challenges and patent wars and mergers and acquisitions and stuff.

01:02:48 I remember a long time ago, I went to go see Guido and he was with the App Engine team

01:02:53 at Google.

01:02:54 So a long time ago.

01:02:55 And he was starting the process of turning over PEP review to other people.

01:03:00 And I commented to him that not every open source success story outlives its founder.

01:03:06 And the bigger it gets, particularly open source projects anchored in the United States

01:03:12 of America, they sell out and get funded and they will never be the same after that.

01:03:19 And so it's a moment from a Python trends perspective for us to build a great next future

01:03:26 by remembering how lucky we are where we have gotten to.

01:03:30 Absolutely.

01:03:31 Carol, Jody, Paul, thank you for being on the show.
