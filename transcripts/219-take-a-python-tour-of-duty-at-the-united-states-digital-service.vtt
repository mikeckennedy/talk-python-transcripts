If you're a software developer who wants to take your special skills and help your country,

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.840
what should you do? Join the military? That's a good option for some, but it might not be a good

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.500
fit for you personally. In the United States, we have a very interesting civil option that's quite

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.260
new, the United States Digital Service. This service was created by President Obama to fix

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.580
broken government software systems, such as the rocky start to the healthcare system.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.800
Developers and designers can serve in this service for as little as three months or as

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.360
long as four years, and they get paid roughly market rates. It's an interesting model indeed,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.020
and I'm excited to have David Holmes from the U.S. Digital Service here to talk about their projects

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.100
and how they're using Python to make the government work for the people.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.440
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 219, recorded June 19th, 2019.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:01:02.580
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the ecosystem,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.260
and the personalities. This is your host, Michael Kennedy. Follow me on Twitter, where I'm at,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.140
helps support the show. Hey, everyone. Before we get to the interview, I want to quickly tell you

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.040
about a new course we just launched. It's our first major Flask course, and it's called Building

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.860
Data-Driven Web Apps in Flask and SQLAlchemy. This one's a deep dive into Flask. We cover things like

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.660
routing models, templates, databases, and migrations, and even deployment and security. And we do all of

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:49.000
this in the context of building a clone of the pypi.org website. Check it out over at training.talkpython.fm.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.140
If you're not sure if you want to choose Flask just yet for your web app, then give our 100 days of

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.040
web course a look. We cover many frameworks and programming models in 25 four-day projects,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.620
so you get a super wide view of what's out there. Then you could pick Flask or Django or Pyramid or

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.620
something else. Thanks for checking it out. Now let's get to the interview. David, welcome to Talk

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.660
Python to Me. Hey, Michael. I'm glad to be on it. Yeah, it's an honor to have you here. It sounds like

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.700
you're doing some really cool stuff at a place that honestly wasn't on my radar until we started

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.780
talking, but it's such a cool idea. So I'm really looking forward to talking about the United States

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.160
digital service with you and what all this is. But before we get into all that, of course,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.260
let's start with your story. How did you get into programming?

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.300
I got into programming. So when I was a kid, I had a computer that was left to me. It was the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.060
HP 6475Z. You remember the model name and everything. I would take that computer apart and put it back

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.520
together. I had a zip drive, like a zip 100-inchabyte drive, if you remember those.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.880
Yeah, was those the purple drives, those big purple drives that were like weird, expensive disks?

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.680
This one I had internal, which is like pretty cool, but it was like super used disks.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.620
It's like a floppy disk times three.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.100
Yeah, it was like a hard drive that you could take out, sort of. It was weird. I remember those.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.940
But those were cool.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.020
It was just 100 megabytes.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.080
Yeah, they were huge. I mean, 100 megabytes. Those are huge, right? I could download that now

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.160
in like three seconds, but it was a big deal then.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.480
At the time, it was like the best thing ever. And I would just take that computer apart,

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.360
put it together nonstop. And then once I kind of got bored to take it apart and put it back

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.220
together a hundred times, I started reading online about this thing, Linux,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.420
and everybody's using it. And so my grandma, so I wanted to use it, but I had dial-up at the time.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.660
And so I had to like ask my grandma for some money for it. And she was just like, over the

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.800
summer, she was just like, you're going to do a bunch of chores. So you get $20 for that way

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.240
I can order the CD. And it was MainTrade Linux. And then I got that CD. And this is back when

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.960
Linux did not have great drive support like it does now. I mean, it still could be a little bit better,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.780
but so I sort of happened to like dig deep into like the C drivers and like edited and like kind

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.500
of like see if that worked. Cause I wanted to get my network in Linux.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.740
That's right. Like maybe that zip drive doesn't have a driver. So you're out of luck or something

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.280
weird like that. Right. So as you know, my next day, they do a lot in Python. So that was just my

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.120
default choice of writing like just scripts and things like that. And then so forth over time,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.200
ended up learning PHP because I want to get more into web development and a lot of businesses use PHP.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.800
But for me, Python was always my go to when I wanted to just do something like a quick script

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.300
and stuff. And then I got into Node.js because it was like super simple to sort of a server. Then

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.340
like Flask came out for Python. So I started going back into Python. And yeah, from there,

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.620
I just been kind of using Python ever since for all my personal projects. Outside of like the here and

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.000
there, like I want to try something new thing. Like I had been working on a little bit of GoLang and

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.380
stuff, which is pretty cool.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.900
Yeah, that's cool. So did you go to college for this or are you pretty much self-taught?

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.940
Pretty much self-taught. So I did go to college, but I went there for business and not really for

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.460
programming. And then I switched to a computer science major. But then I realized that a lot

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.800
of it was teaching me was Java and things like that. I wanted to do web development. So what I ended up

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.700
doing was going to a ton of hackathons. Like I probably went to 20 plus hackathons over a year.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.760
Oh, wow. That's awesome.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.000
And just sort of working with people in the community. I was going like every weekend at one point.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.500
You're like, I got a hackathon problem.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.880
Yeah, at one point, it kind of felt like that. My girlfriend was not my wife.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.680
At the time, it's like, man, you're just constantly going to these things.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.260
And then from there, I started meeting people in the community and from there just sort of getting

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.960
better at doing web development stuff. And I ended up getting my first job at an ad tech company in

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.140
New York City. And that opened the doors up for me to then get into the tech industry more.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.720
Yeah, that's really cool. You know, I think that's interesting that you started out in business

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.960
and you were kind of already doing programming and you tried your hand at the computer science

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.980
degrees. I felt personally, at least the time when I was in college, that the computer science degrees

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.940
were interesting, but they were not really teaching you to build applications and websites

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.520
in the sense that maybe you do as a professional developer.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.520
It was more like really theoretical stuff that, you know, probably is interesting.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.840
But how often do you do like teach you how to build operating systems or like understand how like

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.840
quick sort works and how to maybe create new algorithms and genetic algorithms and like all that stuff

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.460
super interesting. But it's not going to help me, you know, build like a scalable website per se, right?

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.800
And that's what's kind of like after I did the business and the computer science courses, it's like,

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.300
look, I'm making a ton of progress in the hackathon world. So I sort of dropped out of college and just

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.140
sort of pursuing my career from there.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.160
Yeah, that's cool. I kind of did the same thing with grad school. I'm like, you know what,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.120
the stuff I'm doing on the side is way more productive of you. So I will go do that.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:40.220
You worked in New York. There's a lot of big time startups and tech companies in New York.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.940
And so that must have been a fun scene to be in, especially with all the hackathons right around

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:44.360
there, right?

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.120
Yeah. And then I guess from there, I went from my hackathon, you know, addiction to sort of

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.280
startup addiction. I just had to work with tons of different startups.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.480
Cool.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.440
It was really fun. And the scene, like you said, it's like pretty amazing.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.920
For sure. That brings us to today and what you're doing today, which is interesting that,

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.120
you know, the U S government doesn't sound very startup like, but the United States digital

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:13.120
service, which you have to tell us what that is. It's kind of got this sort of like stealth startup

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.380
skunkworks mode within the government, right?

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:21.140
Yep. We treat ourselves as like a startup within the government and pretty much for those who don't

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:26.540
know what U S digital service is. So basically we started in 2014 with healthcare.gov. If your

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.180
listeners remember that, how bad it was and how much it was on CNN and things like that.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.860
And president Obama was just asking his advisors and he said, Hey, how come on the campaign trail,

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.240
we can accept millions of donations. But when we were trying to get millions of people, healthcare,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.700
like the thing crashes and they had to explain like, you know, president of Obama, the way

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.420
we build things in privacy is different than government. And sometimes things can be very

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.100
complex in government. So president Obama said, how about we try this? How about we take some

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.860
people from the private industry and just throw them to healthcare.gov and see what happens.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.360
And as the story goes over the next couple of weeks, we was able to help get healthcare.gov

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.660
back up and 20 plus million people now on health insurance, health insurance. And the president

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.880
said, this works so well, how about we start something like this? And that's how U S digital

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.860
service formed. We're about to be five years old this year, which is pretty amazing. We're

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.940
going to be celebrating our fifth birthday in August. And yeah, ever since then, then we

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.420
sort of did this tour of duty model where we have people come as short as three months of the four

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.580
years and from private industry kind of take a break and help serve their country in just a different

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.200
capacity using the skills that they have.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.040
That's a really cool idea. And I, you know, I feel like I have not worked with the government

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:36.520
very much, but my experience there is that it's, I don't know, there's a lot of friction and it,

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:43.940
whenever I have to go to some sort of government website, like just yesterday, I had to go find,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.720
I don't know, some form and fill out something for the postal service. And I was like, wow,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.580
this website is bad. Like, why is it like this? You know what I mean? And it's just,

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.500
it's really interesting to think of how you might systematically go through these government

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:04.000
agencies and upgrade them and modernize them and just sort of put more lightweight systems in place,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.160
like not just systems in software, but systems as in the way people work.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.800
We're about 170 people strong and we're a mix of designers, procurement folks, engineers.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.680
We have an awesome talent team, awesome comms team. But one of the groups here, you know,

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.560
I'm in engineering. One of the groups here I really take pride of is our design team who goes on,

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.860
does a ton of user research and making sure that we actually build the right thing.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.700
That sounds easy, but that's really, really hard. And one of our values here at USDS is we design

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.940
with users, not for them. So we make sure that the users are included in every single conversation

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.500
that we have.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.380
I can imagine it's easy to walk up to some antiquated system and go, well, this is written in

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:45.960
Cobalt and it's all client server and these things are broken. So let's, you know, make it a API with

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.900
Flask or whatever. But really maybe the idea is like the only reason this thing exists is because it's

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.580
bridging this, these other systems that actually, those are the things you need to modernize or like,

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.540
it just needs a different approach, right? Like people can get into ruts and especially in the government,

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.000
I would think.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.220
Yeah.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.940
Just to sort of round out, you work in the engineering department at United States Digital

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.980
Service doing software engineering there, right?

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:12.060
So I'm the director of engineering and my journey to becoming director of engineering. So when I first

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:17.640
came on board to United States Digital Service, I went out to Social Security Administration to help

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.720
with the disability claims processing system. And then from there, I went to Department of Education

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.960
where my mandate was to help with student debt in default. And then from there, I went to Small Business

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:34.180
Administration where I helped make it easier for people to apply for the 8A program, which is just a

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:40.000
disadvantaged program where if you are disadvantaged, a historically disadvantaged business, you can apply

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.260
for this program and it would allow you to at least have a level playing field with some of these big,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:50.440
big vendors that the government uses. And Congress sets aside billions of dollars for this program.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.860
But one of the problems was because it was part paper and part digital, it would take people too long to

00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.380
figure out the process and they would hire lawyers. And at the expense of the lawyers, it would turn out to be

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:05.700
$30,000 just to hire the lawyers. It felt it's free form. So what we did was make it simple, right? And we made it

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:11.720
100% digital. So that way, folks don't have to pay $30,000. And as we know, if you're able to be in an equal

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.200
playing field with the rest of these big businesses as a disadvantaged business, then you're able to uplift your

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.160
community and hiring people. So it had these downstream effects of just as soon as these people was able to apply for the

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.480
program and get into it, it was able to have tremendous...

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.960
Yeah, it opened up all this opportunity, right? Yeah, for sure. I mean, when I think about working with like these

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.700
requests for proposals and other stuff that the government agencies have, it's just like, well,

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:38.660
you know, big companies have people whose job it is to understand what that actually means,

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:44.740
the flow that it actually goes through. Like it just is so opaque and challenging. So anything you can do to make that

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:51.560
simpler seems really good to like, shake up the incumbents, you know, the big Lockheeds or whatever

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.260
that are like the ones that kind of know the process, right?

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:59.600
Yep. And so for that website, it was certified sba.gov. And then after that, I went to FEMA where we helped

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.200
with the grants management modernization project, which is we're trying to take 10 different grant

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.040
systems, which can be kind of confusing to navigate. And how do we shrink it down to just one system that's

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:13.460
easy to use? And then from there, I became director of engineering. So we had quite a journey at USGS.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.020
Lots of impact.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.700
That is quite a journey. Yeah. And, you know, one of the things I think is really interesting,

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:24.360
like it's super fun to work at startups. You talked about that in your startup addiction for a while,

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:29.460
which is super cool. And you have all this fun tech, but one of the challenges is, you know,

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:34.280
sometimes those startups, they don't really go very far, right? And you work really hard to build out

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.560
some product and only a couple of people use it, right? Hopefully that's not the case.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:42.820
And if you're getting hired there, you know, it may be well beyond that. Writing software is super fun,

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:47.700
but if people don't use it or it doesn't have an impact, then it's a whole lot less fun than,

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:53.660
you know, what you can imagine. But I imagine working on things like FEMA is pretty gratifying,

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:59.400
right? You know, there's a hurricane, it wipes out, you know, some region of the country. People are,

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.780
you know, they're in a serious, they're like, it's an emergency, right? Federal emergency,

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:08.460
whatever, right? So you're there to help. And I suspect that's pretty gratifying.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.460
It really is. Just all the different agencies that we worked on, this is really amazing that

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:19.000
you can see the impact of it and sometimes firsthand. And I think one of the things for me is,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.660
so because of our tour of duty models, I'm coming up on my fourth year. It's like,

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:26.580
what do I do next? Like there's tons of opportunity to be a tons of alumni, but it's like,

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.920
where do I go next to find this impact? So it used to happen.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.060
For sure. I can imagine like, what am I going to build? That's going to help 20 million people

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:39.300
or something like that, right? So you mentioned this duty model, which I think is pretty interesting.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:46.840
Like a lot of countries have like a civil service or even military service that is mandatory,

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:53.760
right? Germany has it. Israel has it. Turkey has it. The U.S. doesn't really have something like that.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.860
And like, say in Germany, there's the military, you could go into the military or you can go into like

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:04.080
a civil service and say, drive an ambulance or be an EMT or something to this effect, right?

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.440
So in the U.S., we don't really have that. We have the military, but it's, you know,

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.820
volunteer only. I don't know much else beyond that. You know, maybe Peace Corps, but that's not a U.S.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:18.260
thing. So this duty model, I think is pretty interesting. You want to tell us about it?

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.160
Yeah. So you can come on short as three months up to four years. So, you know, maybe you want to

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.700
take a break at, you know, your regular day job and just help, you know, create impact at

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.040
at the federal level in the government. Maybe you see something in the news that really inspires you

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.480
and you're like, hey, where can I go to go help with something just for a short time, right? Because,

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.900
you know, maybe you don't want to move from San Francisco or Seattle to D.C.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.460
And you can just come in for a short time. So we have an engineer right now that's coming just for

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:49.620
three months and it's having tons of impact right now at the particular agency that they are at.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.740
And it came for three months because they have a perfect school and their child out where they live in

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.500
Michigan. And they're like, they don't want to leave their child, you know, to come to D.C.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.200
and their friends and things like that. But it's summer vacation now. So they was able to,

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.600
you know, take a three-month sabbatical and come help in just a different way. And the kids get to

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:09.320
come enjoy some of the D.C. weather and all the free museums that we have and all those things.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.960
So I think that's really amazing that we could do that. And you could just stay up to four years and

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.720
just have tons of impact at different places. And that's what I love about the tour of duty model

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:22.540
that we have here because then what enables is people who maybe wouldn't want to be permanent

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:28.140
federal employees to come in and actually help the federal government and in many different ways.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:36.140
But it also allows for folks to have that impact that they maybe not would have had before.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:43.180
Right. Maybe you're like a super good developer at some tech company in San Francisco or Portland or

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:48.140
whatever. And you see, you know, kind of what I described like, whoa, this stuff is messed up.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:52.000
I could probably really improve this if I just worked on this for three or four weeks. Right.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.700
We could really help this process or whatever. Right. But you don't necessarily want to say,

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:02.260
leave the West Coast, drop out of your tech position and say, I'm just going to become a government

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.420
employee. Like that's, you know, it's great. Some people want that. But a lot of people I can see that

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:11.180
as like, you know, that's just a deal breaker for me. Right. But the fact that you could drop in for,

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:16.480
say, a summer and come work on something like that actually sounds super cool to me.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.640
One of the things that that's amazing and like why I love our tour to the model again is because

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.920
you can come in and actually bring in new stuff in the private industry. So sometimes you find that

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:31.260
people in government who work there 20 plus years, they know what they only know. And, you know,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:36.160
maybe it's COBOL, maybe it's mainframes. And it's great that we can have this constant revolving door

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.940
of just new people, new ideas, fresh ideas. Because as we know, tech industry is changing every year. Right.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.660
And we can have these new folks come in and actually question the status quo and say like,

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.420
okay, this should be better. And in the private industry, this is what we do today. And some

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:55.320
folks are just increasingly questioning impact at tech companies. And we have just a clear approach

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.980
where we, where anything you do in the federal government, you have a chance to impact millions

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.240
and millions of people to make their lives a little bit easier and better.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:09.760
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by the Local Maximum podcast. The Local Maximum is

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.840
dedicated to examining emerging technology, software, and social trends through the perspective of machine

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:19.700
learning engineer, Max Sklar and his guests. Max talks to creative engineers and entrepreneurs about

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:24.560
building products and emerging technology. The Local Maximum takes concepts from the machine learning

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:30.060
and data science world and applies them to current events and everyday life. The show speaks specifically to

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:34.280
people working in the software industry and challenges you to think critically about the projects you work

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.220
on and the teams you join, as well as practical advice for growing your career. That's why engineers

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:43.420
and product developers are tuning in to the Local Maximum. And you can get it anywhere you listen to

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:49.100
podcasts or just visit talkpython.fm/max. And if I can recommend an episode, you should check out

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:57.380
number 73. That's interesting. Maybe we could dig into that for a second. Like, I would say, you know, you talked

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:02.780
about taking this computer apart and, and getting the zip drive and just all the early days. And I felt like

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:09.160
in the early days, just technology was just clearly a good, right? It was going to connect people, it was going

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:16.140
to empower people who maybe didn't, you know, live in a big city, or there's just so many cool things that it

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:21.320
made possible, right? Like the first time I used Shazam, right? My mind was just blown, right? Like

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.940
it knows what song is playing. It's like magic in my hand, right? But I feel like it's, I don't know,

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:30.740
it's, it's a bit of more of a mixed bag these days. Yeah. And like a huge thing is, you know, data and

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:36.480
privacy and like, why are we building this? And one of the things in government is like, we are privacy by

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:41.580
default. So everywhere you'll see signs like PII, don't, don't do PII. And like, that's a huge thing in

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.100
governments and make sure that privacy is enabled. And that's one thing I didn't understand.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:50.180
I came into government originally. I thought that like the IRS talks to everybody, right? I just

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.620
assumed every federal agency had my tax information and could just easily get it.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.620
Right. The DMV knows, they know.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:01.940
They just know me. I'm like, I have to fill F-86 and I was like, don't you have all this information on me?

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:08.360
And the reality is, no, the government is pretty siloed because the government by default tries to do,

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:14.460
tries to be as privacy concerned as possible. So for example, in the IRS, they have a law called 6103,

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:19.640
where people just can't get access to your tax return. And that's a good thing. For me,

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.660
that's like a huge benefit. And like, even in my personal life, I'm super privacy conservative. I don't

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:27.900
like using social media or I don't have social media because like I care about my privacy a lot. And

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.640
like, it's interesting when I came into government, I assumed everything was open to federal employees.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.540
And that's just not true.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:39.360
That's pretty interesting. So a few more questions of the duty model. Like, do you guys, you know, you talked about this person come from Michigan,

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:47.600
people come from the tech industry. It sounds like these are paid positions that people can come and take.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.100
They can take them for three months, but they could also take them for four years.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:56.660
One, is that right? Are these regular paid jobs with all the benefits or do you guys accept interns?

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:01.580
What experience do you have to have? Like, can you come in as like, hey, I took a boot camp.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:06.580
I know some stuff, but I'm not really quite that great yet, but I'd love to be part of this.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.300
Like, what's the spectrum look like there?

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:14.840
So we tried to do a myth of a career folks that said looking at us in between just because they come with that experience.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.820
I can sit in the room with like a secretary and folks like that.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:25.340
But we do hire like exceptional engineers who are young, but the salaries are competitive.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.140
It is a federal job and you do get paid for it. You can't work for the government for free.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:34.620
And it maxes out at a GS-15 step 10, which is about $164,000 a year.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.180
So that's pretty competitive in industry, I see.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.820
The only thing is you get really, really good benefits, but you don't get the stock options that you may get in the startup.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:47.020
You know, that could be good or that might, you know, that might just go to zero, right?

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.160
Like you might pay taxes on it and that it goes to zero, right?

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.360
It might even be worse than zero.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.900
I think that's interesting, right?

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.040
Like, obviously you don't get the equity.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.180
I mean, maybe you do, but what are you going to do?

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:58.700
Sell the government?

00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:59.540
It doesn't matter, right?

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:06.340
So I do think it's an interesting model and it's cool that it's a paid program with somewhat competitive rates.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.240
I mean, competitive is always relative, right?

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:16.280
Competitive to somebody working downtown San Francisco and competitive to somebody working the outskirts of Kansas City.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.900
Like those are, you know, multiples of different salaries that might be competitive, right?

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:26.200
But it's still, it's cool that it's accessible to like most folks in terms of salary.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.940
On the equity part, like we all have equity in this country, right?

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:32.000
We want to make this sure of this country that's, you know, great as possible.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.460
So the impact that you can have here is like amazing.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.260
Yeah, for sure.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:36.700
That's cool.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:46.280
One of the things I think that is cool about places like Stanford and Harvard and some of these high-end education places is not so much what you learn, right?

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:52.800
Like you and I are both significantly self-taught in programming and I feel like we could probably, you know, hang with a lot of those folks.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:22:00.760
But what's really interesting is the connections you make and sort of the groups you get to run in and so on.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.700
I feel like there might be something kind of like this here.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:11.980
Do you feel like there's a lot of, you talked about alumni and stuff, a lot of interesting connections or even companies that get started after these tours of duty?

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.340
Definitely before USCIS.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.360
Like, you know, I feel like I can run with the best of them.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.520
But now I feel like after USCIS, I'm going to have tons of connections and networks.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:30.040
So because we hire people from all sorts of all places around the country and from all different types of companies, from big, huge ones from Google to small startups.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:35.780
And some folks go back into the company that they came from originally because they just did a short tour of duty model.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:42.180
But one of the things that's amazing that I find here is how many people go out and start their own company.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:46.340
So we have people who successfully got into Y Combinator at the USDS.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:55.400
We have people who said, when something after my tour of duty, I find that the problem may be easy to tackle from the outside than the inside and has started startups.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.000
That's now part of this thing called the Digital Coalition.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.220
Some people stay in public service.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:06.240
So the former director of engineering here at USCIS became deputy CIO over at OPM.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:14.020
We have one of our former product folks, shout out folks, became the CIO over at Center for Medicare and Medicare Services.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:19.140
And former alumni, Charles Worthington became CTO of the VA.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.200
So some people stay in government.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.260
Some people go back at the private industry.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:27.380
But I find that those connections and that network of people is invaluable.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.140
And today, like I said before, we are 170 people strong.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.580
But our alumni now is at 200 strong.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.020
I'm sure that's really interesting.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:42.280
You know, once you get inside the system, I'm sure it opens your eyes to ways things could be done better.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:48.040
You know, like the big deal with a lot of startups is disrupting like semi-broken models.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:48.320
Right.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:54.400
Like we have Airbnb with hotels, Uber, super like I taxis make me crazy.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.720
Like I feel like I'm being both ripped off and inconvenienced at the same time.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:58.920
Right.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.380
It's just like, oh, these taxis.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:06.260
And, you know, they came along and for better or worse, they've done a lot to like smooth over those edges.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:15.060
But if you're inside the government and you work at with these agencies, I'm sure there's a ton of opportunities to see how you could create a business that would kind of do the same.

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.540
But in that space, what do you think?

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.420
Yeah, I think there's tons of opportunity.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.100
And sometimes it's hard to make change from inside.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:25.040
And sometimes it's easier to make a change from outside depending on your project.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:31.560
And, you know, you mentioned like a couple of companies and like some people don't want to do make the next Uber for dog walkers.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:31.740
Right.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:36.300
We get an opportunity to, you know, have some amazing impact.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:48.600
Yeah, I do feel like startups are interesting, but a lot of times they're kind of, I don't know what's the right way to put it, but they're not contributing like a whole ton of value to the world.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:57.940
They're just, I don't know, like making some little tiny tech thing better or more fun, but it's not the same as like helping veterans or whatever.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:04.140
You talked about this article on Hacker News in your profile, which I thought was pretty interesting.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.040
I'm going to link to this Hacker News article.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.740
Maybe you could summarize it a little bit for us, but I'm going to do a little excerpt from it.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:15.960
So talking about like what the USDS is trying to solve and some of these tech problems that people run into.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:31.040
So one of the commenters on here said, yeah, my friend described a process in one government department where digital documents were received, they were printed, and then they're physically mailed to some back office site and then manually entered into a system by typing.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.320
The contract for scanning was worth millions of dollars.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.940
And the contract for the back end was also worth millions.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.880
And people's jobs depend on this whole useless exercise.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:52.540
But the reason it was super hard to reform because like why would that company that has this whole business of people like entering stuff want to just make it an API that's like, you know, one one thousandth of revenue or whatever.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:52.820
Right.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.860
That sounds like a lot of those problems.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:59.760
That's kind of what I was thinking of when like you could disrupt those things if you were not part of that system.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.240
Right.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.720
You can also disrupt it internally.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.060
Right.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.120
So then we can come in and say like, yeah, maybe you shouldn't do that.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.240
Why are you doing this?

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.900
And like, here's a better way of doing that.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:15.700
And one of the things that we become super successful at is sometimes we just build prototypes and just show the agency and say like, look, here's a better way of doing it.

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.120
Here's this prototype with an API.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.740
Then it can make the lives a lot easier.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.800
Yeah, you know, an example that's really recent and was just in the news.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:37.920
I don't know if it has anything at all to do with you guys, but there was this proposal for the United States tax service, the IRS, to basically make an online system.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.040
So it's super easy for most people to file their taxes online.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.120
Just fill out, you know, like a few forms and you're good.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.180
If you don't have like really complicated consulting or whatever.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.440
And there was a huge pushback.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:54.360
Even in Congress, there was a pushback for like, well, we don't want that.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.340
We don't want people to have this for free.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.280
There's businesses that are built on this.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:58.520
Right.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.500
What is Intuit going to do?

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:00.760
Right.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.540
Things like this.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.520
That was crazy.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.160
That's one of the things that we hope to make an impact on from the inside.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:05.960
Yeah, that's cool.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.600
I definitely I do think that that one out that they said, no, actually, this is bad.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:16.600
But yeah, I mean, there's really sketchy stuff like some of the companies that were supposed to be filling that gap and providing the free stuff.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:20.740
They were putting like a robots TXT to say, don't index the free stuff.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.900
So you can't Google for it.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.080
And it was really weird.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.080
So I'm really glad to see that that's making progress.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.200
But let's talk about some of the projects that you guys are working on.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:34.540
So it sounds like the genesis of this whole thing was let's come in and fix healthcare.gov.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.980
Like that was sort of the origin, huh?

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:43.720
Yeah, pretty much the origin of let's go in and see if we can take people from the private industry, drop them into government and see if they can fix healthcare.gov.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.320
And then that turned out to be successful.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.840
And then it was just like, hey, let's see if we can replicate this across different agencies.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.140
There's a lot of stuff that's like that.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.400
Let's just start going from one to one and start fixing them.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.260
That's super.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:58.520
Another one was VA.gov, which is the Veterans Association, right?

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.700
For veterans of the military service, right?

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.300
That involved a lot of Python fixing up, right?

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.260
Tell us about that one.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.040
Tech stack for that is Ruby on Rails.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.700
But a lot of like the DevOps scripts involve Python.

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:10.040
Okay.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.280
Yeah, not so much Python.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.440
One of the things that we found when we go to these different agencies is they already have a team established.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.700
And we like to try to use the tools that they're familiar with.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.280
So like in my personal capacity, I love Python.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:27.300
You know, in a different agency, they may be a Ruby on Rails shop or a Java shop or even in some cases a Cobalt shop.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:31.080
And it just makes sense to try and work with what they currently are using.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.540
So that way, we don't have to rebuild everything from scratch.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.980
And on top of that, train all the engineers on this new thing.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.340
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Rollbar.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:42.760
Got a question for you.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.460
Have you been outsourcing your bug discovery to your users?

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:48.080
Have you been making them send you bug reports?

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.820
You know, there's two problems with that.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.780
You can't discover all the bugs this way.

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.360
And some users don't bother reporting bugs at all.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.240
They just leave, sometimes forever.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:00.060
The best software teams practice proactive error monitoring.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:06.420
They detect all the errors in their production apps and services in real time and debug important errors in minutes or hours,

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.440
sometimes before users even notice.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:13.540
Teams from companies like Twilio, Instacart, and CircleCI use Rollbar to do this.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:19.620
With Rollbar, you get a real-time feed of all the errors so you know exactly what's broken in production.

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:26.800
And Rollbar automatically collects all the relevant data and metadata you need to debug the errors so you don't have to sift through logs.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.760
If you aren't using Rollbar yet, they have a special offer for you, and it's really awesome.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:39.840
Sign up and install Rollbar at talkpython.fm/Rollbar, and Rollbar will send you a $100 gift card to use at the Open Collective,

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:47.300
where you can donate to any of the 900-plus projects listed under the Open Source Collective or to the Women Who Code organization.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:50.920
Get notified of errors in real time and make a difference in Open Source.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.840
Visit talkpython.fm/Rollbar today.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:00.640
That makes a lot of sense because you don't want to just go in there and say, well, we're throwing out all your code.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.520
Here's a bunch of Python.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.240
And yeah, I know you know Java, but too bad, Python.

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.460
And then leave, right?

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.800
And say, now go be productive, right?

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.580
So it's not really exactly what the mission is, yeah?

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:10.940
Yeah.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:16.820
So we just try and work with our stakeholders and our partners on what's the best solution for not just them, but also for the American people.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:17.140
Yeah.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:25.520
So it sounds like part of that project was this wait times API to help build systems around understanding if you can go see a doctor or something like that.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:25.900
Is that right?

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.940
One of the things is developers.va.gov, where there was a lot of work that we helped with.

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:35.720
They're just setting up APIs and making sure that the people on the ground can deploy these APIs in an efficient way.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.940
And one of them is the wait time one.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.080
So you can actually build an app right now.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.940
You get an API key to help veterans figure out the wait times.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:50.180
I think it even goes even down into details of wait times for what specific doctor you're looking forward to.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.660
And you can pick the best API around you.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.060
Yeah, cool.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.740
So yeah, there's even a developer.va.gov.

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.180
And that's pretty cool, the whole API platform and stuff.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:58.740
Nice.

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.900
Another one was Medicare and Medicaid.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.680
Oh, so you're talking about the blue button API.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.040
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:09.640
One of the things we found out is that folks don't go to government sites for everything, right?

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.560
And doctors want to use their software that they use normally for the rest of the patient.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:20.480
So what we did was build this API that allows, in just a secure way, people can verify their identity in just a secure way,

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:25.520
and give those healthcare records to the doctors and the systems that works best for them.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:31.440
And that's a huge thing because Medicare and Medicaid has 57 million beneficiaries within it.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:37.980
So now these beneficiaries can be able to transfer their health records to the doctors using this API, which is really, really cool.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:43.320
Yeah, that's a huge part of the economy, but also people's lives, right?

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.120
On the website, it says there was 8 million lines of Cobalt.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:52.640
And this part blows my mind, 2.5 million lines of assembly code.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.780
Like, that's crazy.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.940
These are some systems that haven't been updated in 60, 70 years.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.240
So we kind of come in.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:05.900
And it's interesting because, particularly for this project, we had an engineer buy a Cobalt book, right?

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:10.780
And learn Cobalt and try to learn Cobalt so we can help out with this project.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.240
And now, like, I was talking to them before they left the tour.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:19.100
They were like, yeah, you know, I know you didn't expect to come in to do Cobalt, but you left now knowing Cobalt.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:19.860
You can put it on your resume.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:22.340
How many places can you go to where you could do that?

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:25.200
You can get Cobalt experience.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.400
Yeah, that's pretty wild.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:34.280
Like, I doubt anybody, not anybody, I doubt many people want to work in Cobalt, especially from, you know, scratch these days.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:40.820
But there's got to be a huge opportunity to know Cobalt and modern stuff and be part of that transition.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:41.760
Huge opportunity.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.260
Like, for me, for example, I didn't even know they still wrote books about Cobalt, right?

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:47.700
I was just like, where do you find one at?

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.100
Like, do you go to your local libraries and on Amazon?

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:56.560
But you're huge if you could just come in and even just, you know, pick up Cobalt just to help modernize something.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:04.080
So one thing I find that that's really cool that we're doing at CMS and HHS is right now there's a Medicare payment processing system.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.240
That's all written in Cobalt for the most part.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.500
And they went and modernized and they tried modernizing it for multiple times.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:12.640
So we did the beginning there and we said, how about we just take a piece of it?

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.900
Just a small piece of what this mainframe Cobalt app does.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.800
And let's put that on the cloud and let's see how that works.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.200
And we've been really, really successful in that.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.360
And now helping human services can see that, okay, you can just take a piece.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.500
You can kind of do a piecemeal.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:31.120
So eventually we're going to get to a point where in a few years we're going to be off of the mainframe and off of Cobalt and have all of that entirely into the cloud.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:39.160
I mean, that's why we still have Cobalt in these mainframes running 2.5 million lines of assembly is because people just say we have to flip the switch.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.980
And what happens when you flip the switch?

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:48.140
And does, you know, they've been built up and layered on top of, you know, change after change for 50 years.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.600
Like how hard is that to recreate from scratch?

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.220
It's got to be tough.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.380
Yeah, super tough.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.180
And it's a huge program, right?

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.680
And a lot of people depend on this.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.040
And we're worried that a couple of things, right?

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:04.460
That there won't be enough Cobalt developers to help maintain this because healthcare laws change every single year.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.320
And 10,000 people enroll in this every single day.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.360
So it can't go down.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.740
It's in Medicare.

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.580
Medicaid is about 4% of the GDP.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:17.740
So even if it goes down for an hour, you're talking hundreds of millions of dollars and payments that's not going on to doctorate.

00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:18.040
Right.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.760
And people who have to have like emergency surgery and all sorts of stuff, right?

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:27.580
Or even worse, maybe like some kind of, you know, they didn't get that test that would have let them know they had cancer.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:30.820
So they could have gotten early treatment or some bad knock on effect, right?

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:34.080
That's like the things that sort of keep me up every day.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.440
Making sure that like systems like that don't go down, right?

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:42.960
Because if they go down, that really does have like effect on a ton of people's lives.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.140
And in some cases, it's literally life in depth, right?

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:46.520
Yeah.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.360
That keeps me up at night.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.240
Make sure to do that.

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:54.920
And I'm glad like the team that we have over there is just kind of saying like, hey, let's not do it this waterfall way that we keep trying.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.700
That's not working, right?

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.100
Like let's try it this agile way.

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:01.820
Let's do it piece by piece and eventually we'll get it to the cloud and then we can scale this out.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:05.580
So, you know, as you know, like in most places, like they have open enrollments, right?

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.920
So that's when you need the most servers.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:17.420
So then we can scale that up when we need the most servers and scale it down as needed and be cost effective, but also be able to help folks in need at the time of them being in need.

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:17.940
Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:23.160
Well, and also just hire people, interesting, talented people, right?

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:30.100
Because if you're looking around for jobs, you're like, oh, there's this cool robotic company in Pittsburgh I could work for.

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.180
They're doing JavaScript.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.140
I'd rather do Python.

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:35.000
Oh, there's this Medicare place that does Cobalt and assembly.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:35.860
Should I go work for that?

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:36.180
No.

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:36.900
Right?

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.140
Like that's just, it's got to be a lot of the thinking, right?

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:42.800
But if all of a sudden it's like, hey, help us move to the cloud, do a bunch of microservices.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.920
It'll be fun, right?

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.620
Like all of a sudden that's a different set of people you could reach.

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:47.200
Yeah, agreed.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.180
Yeah, for sure.

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.960
So another understatement, right?

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.380
So other project that looked cool was the college scorecard.

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:55.040
Tell us about that.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.120
This was a project that we did at Department of Education.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.340
This is part of the mandate of how do we get students out of debt in the fall?

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.220
And one of the things that we found is several things, right?

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:10.060
That a lot of people don't even apply for Fast Food for financial aid because they just assume they won't get it.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:16.120
So we built this to like say, like, hey, no, actually on average, based upon a range of your family's income,

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:19.460
for this particular school, you can get financial aid.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:25.000
And another thing that we realized was that some people go into them in the fall because they don't realize how much the college or the program would cost.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:33.300
So one of the things that we worked with the college scorecard was making sure that not only do we tell you how much on average a four-year degree or two-year degree at that school would cost,

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:43.460
but also what is the average amount of debt people would have in that school and what is the average monthly payment for that school and how much people on average make after that school.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:49.600
And I think that goes a long way to helping you pick the right college for you that can keep you out of debt.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:57.360
Because some people are in hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of student loan debt and they would have just known that before they picked the school or the program and how much money they would make after that.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:03.380
They probably would make a, I'm going to say a different decision, but at least they would have a more informed decision into their process.

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:09.240
But one of the cool things that we learned on that project was people usually don't go to government websites for things like I was saying before.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.120
And so we said, how about we take that data and make it open, right?

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:21.220
And allow where people are actually going to learn about the colleges, allow them to have access to this data that the Department of Education has, and they can display it for the students.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:26.960
So when the students are searching for the perfect college, they can go to the sites that they used to go into to find that information.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:49.520
And what's cool about that is Google saw that and now incorporates college scorecard data into the search results on the side or on mobile on the top, where if you type in like Harvard University or something, it'll pull up those same things of how much the average tuition is, how much, what is the graduation rate, and the acceptance rates for the school and all that's using college scorecard data.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.400
That's super cool.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:58.420
It was really clearly presented to you as a 16-year-old student thinking about which college you're going to pick, 16, 17-year-old.

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:13.480
It says, look, you could apply to this out-of-state school that sounds really awesome, and you could get this degree, and your average income would be, I don't know, let's say $70,000, and your debt will be $200,000, and it'll take you this long to pay that off if you can save this much.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:19.840
Or if you went to your state school, yeah, you only make $65,000, but your debt will be $5,000, something like that, right?

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.340
That might be really worth considering, right?

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:30.460
If it was really clearly laid out, I feel a lot of people just, they chase their dreams and pursue their passions, and of course, you go to the better school.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.620
Well, is it defined better, right?

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:34.080
Yeah.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.640
Academically, maybe, but is $250,000 a debt?

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:56.260
I was at a restaurant here in Oregon, and a waitress, it was summertime, she was home back from college, she was like a senior in college, she was talking to me and said, a person next to me, I started talking to her about her school and what she was studying, and I don't know, she was just oversharing, I guess, or frustrated, needed to let some steam off.

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:59.280
But she's like, yeah, I'm studying, I'm going to become a music teacher.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:05.060
I'm at this, like, one of the elite music schools in Seattle, and it's just home for the summer, it's really great.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:09.300
I almost got my degree, I'm almost going to be a music teacher next year, it's going to be so fun.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:20.000
Only downside is I have $250,000 in student debt, and I thought, like, how does it make any sense if you want to be a music teacher at, like, a middle school or high school to have that much debt, right?

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.240
But, you know, I just, I think some data would be great.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:29.160
That was, like, one of the things that we focused on for the first part of that mandate of just how do we help students get a debt in default, which was,

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:32.320
let's try preventing people from getting into default to begin with.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.660
But then we also said, okay, how do we help the people that's currently in debt in default?

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:43.060
And one of the things we came up with was Wizard, that you can go to, if you go to studentloans.gov, and it's right there on the hero page,

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.420
it's just find out your repayment options.

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:47.960
And from that, you just, you can answer some simple questions, right?

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.940
Like, do you have a federal background?

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:51.500
And are you in default?

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.000
And things like that.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.460
And then depending on how you answer these questions, we can actually have multiple different programs that you qualify for.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:05.980
So one of them is a program called Income Driven Repayment, which just pays a percentage of your salary every single month to paying your student loans down.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:12.320
Instead of this standard 10-year plan that you're normally put into six months after your grace period of your graduating college.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:18.940
So basically, six months after, if you don't have, like, the perfect job for you, then you may, if someone has $250,000 in student loan debt,

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.880
they may end up having to pay, you know, $2,500 a month.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.740
And that's not easy for everybody.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.800
So now you can just pay it based upon your income.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:33.620
One of the greatest parts about that particular project was that, so like most people have student loan debt,

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.000
my sister had student loan debt.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.180
And I was just talking to her at a bar, like, after I moved down to DC, and we worked on this project.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:40.820
We launched it.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.660
The president, the former president of Obama announced it, which was really cool.

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.220
I was just talking to her about it.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:49.400
And she said, yeah, she's trying to figure out, like, how to get out of debt, student loan debt.

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.700
So I said, hey, have you heard of student loans.gov slash repay?

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.640
Like, this project that I worked on.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:41:00.060
And then we went through it, and I found that she was in default of her student loans.

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:04.200
And she qualified for a thing called loan rehabilitation, which is you make nine payments.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.180
You make them once a month, you know, for nine months.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.380
And it could be as little as $5 a month.

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:12.520
And what was really cool about that was, so she did that.

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:17.060
And then she was able to fix her credit because once you get out of that program,

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:20.380
the department of education will go back in your credit and say, you was out of default,

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:22.840
and you was never in default, and you paid this entire time.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.700
Oh, nice.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:24.060
That's awesome.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.280
Yeah.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:29.980
And for some people, like, if your student loan started three years ago, and it goes back three years,

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.220
like, the credit goes up, right?

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.840
And for my sister, her credit went up.

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:36.600
And after that, she was able to buy a car because the credit was able to go up.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:41.120
She couldn't get a loan for a car and then was able to find a better job because she could travel further.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:45.320
And I had to take, like, you know, and New York City, our transportation is pretty cool where I'm originally from.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.160
But, you know, it could take a while.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.600
So she had a car, and now she was able to travel further.

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:54.820
And she also put my niece in, like, basketball programs that she wouldn't have probably put her in otherwise if she didn't have a car.

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:56.280
And all this because of this.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:02.600
So it was, like, really interesting to me that I was able to see, like, the effect of a project that we did just up front and personal and up close.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:03.160
That's cool.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.660
And that's part of that, helping people in effect you talked about, right?

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:05.920
Yeah.

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:07.660
It's wild how personal it was, though, right?

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:08.300
That is your sister.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.200
Yeah, it is.

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.240
That showed me instantly, like, the just amount of impact I can have.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:15.540
So we do a lot of user research here, and we talk to people before and after.

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:16.460
We learn something.

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:22.700
But just, like, seeing my sister and just seeing, like, the actual effects of it because, like, it took a while, right?

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.040
She had to do the nine payments over nine months and things like that.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:31.380
But then able to see that long-term, you know, progress and success is just, like, really amazing.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.700
That's a super cool story.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:39.180
So in all these projects and just the philosophy at the USDS in general, what's the story with open source?

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.780
Like, is it something you strongly push?

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:43.980
Is it just something you use when it makes sense?

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:46.160
Or how do you guys think about open source there?

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.920
We try to open source as much as possible.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:51.240
So, like, VA, if you go to the GitHub, they open source as much as possible.

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.440
Our current website is open source.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.400
We try to open source as much as possible.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:43:01.340
One of the hard parts is, like, sometimes you go in and you find out that the problem isn't just the front end of the website.

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.700
The problem is the back end, right?

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:03.540
That's what takes a while.

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:04.300
It takes adjudicating.

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:08.900
So we built those back end systems to help people get through these processes a lot faster.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:13.560
And that's sometimes hard to open source because it connects to, like, private databases and things like that.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:13.700
Sure.

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:17.580
And it's just so tied up with all the specific details.

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:18.780
Like, it's not reusable, right?

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:23.380
Overall, the government policy for all agencies is to open source at least 20% of their code.

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:24.060
Oh, interesting.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:24.540
That's cool.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:24.960
Yeah.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.140
Do you guys maintain any PyPI packages?

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:29.160
Can I pip install something from USDS?

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.780
Not yet, but we're working on it.

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:34.040
Maybe that's something we'll double down on.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:39.560
But you could go to, like, code.gov, which is just a repository of all the open source code that the government has.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:43.800
Or code.mil, which is a repository of all the open sources the military has.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.560
So there's some potential projects.

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.840
Yeah, yeah.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:47.260
That's cool.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:54.980
Well, and maybe, like, something someone could do if they came for, you know, three months would be to take those things and make them a little more standalone.

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:56.900
Like, get their own, read the docs, right?

00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:00.300
Like, make it sort of more developer discoverable or something.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:00.700
I don't know.

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.720
Like, that sounds like a cool project, actually.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:07.500
Yeah, if your listeners are listening or if you want to come out with that, like, you're more than happy.

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.020
Yeah, yeah.

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:09.700
That'd be solid.

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:17.280
But we do have an open source US forum system that has been forked by the Austin Digital Government Digital Service out there.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.900
And basically what this project is, one thing we realize is government has tons and tons of forums.

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:24.320
So I only make it easier to just build web forums for folks.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.440
And they've been using it.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.440
And it's pretty cool.

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:27.800
And we use it internally here, too.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:28.560
Oh, that's awesome.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:34.720
So one final project, and I want to talk about some of your personal projects in Python because they're very interesting.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.060
They tie back to USDS.

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:44.000
So the final one that's listed, not the final one, but the final one I'm going to talk about listed on USDS.gov is Hack the Pentagon.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.280
So we all saw war games.

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.100
And that was, was that the Pentagon?

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:50.800
I think it was, right?

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:56.860
They were, Matthew Broderick hacked with like a 300-baud modem, got in a bunch of trouble, almost started a nuclear war, right?

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:00.480
Typically hacking the Pentagon is referred to as a bad thing.

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.100
You shouldn't do it.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:05.500
But somehow you guys like sponsored this thing or encouraged people to hack the Pentagon.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:06.180
What's up with that?

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.240
That was extreme.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:13.080
You know, it's especially because of the name, you know, when you go to the Secretary of Defense and say, hey, we want to start a program called Hack the Pentagon.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:17.380
You can like see, like you can imagine the eyes wide and just like hack the Pentagon.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:17.900
Like, no.

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:20.460
You know, how do we work to make that not happen?

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:23.000
And they said like not to do it.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.400
So, so we did it, right?

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.700
They said, like, we can't have this.

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.220
So he was just like, we're going to do it.

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:30.740
Because part of the bad thing is like, you know, we empower and hire great people.

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:33.720
And we can come in and talk to the Secretary of Defense about it.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:37.260
So after we just explained to them that bug problems is not new, right?

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.320
Nextgate did it in 1995.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.380
And a whole ton of companies do it.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:47.340
And this actually would help make you more secure because now people aren't selling these hacks on the black market, right?

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:50.520
They can actually report them to you and you can fix them.

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:58.100
And what's really amazing about that is we had an 18-year-old kid win and go to DEF CON and all that.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:02.700
But when, by hacking the Army, I believe this program was.

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:07.220
And that was pretty cool that we can have like this range of people who can actually go in and say,

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:12.200
hey, I'm going to use my, you know, security skills, my security engineering skills to hack the Pentagon.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.960
And it's going to be okay as long as I report it.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.760
And that program has been super successful.

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:17.980
So we started with Hack the Pentagon.

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.180
Now we have Hack the Army, Hack the Air Force.

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.320
Hack the Marines.

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.660
And, you know, we're doing it like every year.

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:31.160
So it's pretty cool to see that at first it was like hesitant to say, you know, let's do a program called Hack the Pentagon.

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:37.360
But then they saw how extremely useful it was and is now expanding into the rest of the military branches.

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.120
Yeah, that's cool.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:38.120
Yeah, that's cool.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:49.620
The stats you guys hear, like 15 bug bounties are held, over 600 hackers participated and over 7,000 vulnerabilities discovered and presumably closed.

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.820
Yeah, definitely closed.

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:53.440
That's cool.

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.700
But yeah, that's one of the fun ones.

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:56.720
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.640
So a lot of neat projects there.

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:11.040
So one of the things we were talking earlier that you said doesn't work so well in government are some of these newer, modern communication platforms, things like Slack and other stuff.

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:22.700
And it's not just that people resist it, but there's rules about like retaining all the records as just record keeping in case anybody wants to know what the government's up to and things like that, right?

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:25.800
I take a ton of things I got in the private industry, especially startups for granted.

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.460
As soon as I came into government, I was like, yeah, you guys just don't have G Suite?

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:29.200
And it was like, no.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.480
I miss my Gmail.

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:36.260
So one of the things we worked hard on for four years to get this was Slack.

00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:38.840
Because in private industry, it's just really easy.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:42.680
And Slack makes things very, very easy to communicate with everybody.

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:46.920
But one of the problems that they was having with us having Slack was, well, how do you handle records?

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:52.700
And the reason why that's important is because the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act almost basically states that,

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:56.900
you know, all records have to be kept and maintained and also foriable and discoverable.

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:05.960
So one of the things that we said was, OK, well, how about we just create all of the Slack channels and put them into a .eml file?

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:09.940
And then from that .eml, we'll import that into Exchange.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:13.860
So that way it's all discoverable and searchable and people can read it.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.500
And this is a human-friendly way, right?

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:16.860
All the Slack records.

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:20.100
And all of that is built on Python.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:26.820
And we're hoping to open source that soon so that way more government agencies can use Slack.

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:31.660
Because one thing I find that is super useful and how, like, our communications changed once we got Slack was,

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:37.360
instead of having three or four going back and forth emails and then, like, two one-hour-long meetings,

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:40.400
like, this thing could get solved in 30 seconds in a Slack channel.

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.240
Right, right, right.

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:44.720
We're able to make decisions a lot quicker because we have Slack.

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:50.240
And one of, like, my small side projects is, like, how do we expand this to the rest of government?

00:48:50.240 --> 00:49:00.880
And I'm hoping to look forward to do that before the end of the year so that we will have guidance on how you can not only implement Slack into your agency and some of the benefits,

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:04.320
but also how do you handle some of these difficult things like records management.

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:05.260
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:11.700
You know, that probably would be valuable for even outside the government, right, certain large companies or something like that,

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.980
who are afraid of the transient nature of Slack and things like this.

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:22.100
Slack has something really cool on Enterprise Grid where you can encrypt all your conversations so only you have access to it.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.720
And that was something really important to the government, too.

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:30.920
So that Slack doesn't actually have, can't read all of our messages or anything like that because all the messages are encrypted and decrypted at rest.

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.100
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:33.020
Cool.

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:41.040
So, yeah, I suspect one of the challenges with this is, like, even just telling other government agencies this is a thing that now works, right?

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:46.120
Like, just communicating within the giant thing that is the government.

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.680
It can't be that easy.

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:48.380
It is not.

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:54.000
But because we have teams at a lot of different agencies and we have, you know, partners and stakeholders at a lot of different agencies,

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000
we're hoping that once we can provide this guidance that we can just share it with that broader community.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:49:59.500
For sure.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.800
You could also go on a podcast and tell people about it that way.

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:02.240
I could.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.460
I could definitely do that.

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:05.860
Right on.

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:13.220
So another thing, this is a really interesting personal story for you, but it's something I think that will be quite valuable to a lot of folks.

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:16.960
Is this project that you did for, is it your son or daughter?

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:17.780
Oh, my son.

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:20.220
Yeah, it's called School Diversity Report.

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:24.460
When you started the USDS, you had to move from New York City to D.C.

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:31.320
And with kids, that's always, like, it's like half the hassle of moving is figure out where the kids go to school, who's going to take care of them, what do they do?

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.740
Like, there's just so much stuff, right?

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:32.960
Yeah.

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:37.980
And one of the things, so my son was two, I believe, when we moved down there, two, turning three.

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:42.720
And so we had to start preparing that, like, okay, we're here at long term, where does he go to school?

00:50:43.320 --> 00:51:01.280
And I was at Department of Education, and we helped them with this thing called Civil Rights Data Collection, where basically Department of Education goes out to all these different schools with a survey and says, like, okay, break down a lot of your student enrollment by gender or race and ethnicity and, like, a whole bunch of other different things.

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:06.500
And schools answer back, so it's a thing that happens every two years, and it's going to release this data and they ask us for our opinion.

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:08.720
They wanted an API for this.

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:13.320
And we said, well, if it's only once every two years, you don't need to pay a vendor millions of dollars to do an API.

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:19.980
Just release it as a CSV, because most people are going to use Python to view the CSV or, like, R or Arling or something.

00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:20.200
Right.

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.060
We have pandas.

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.380
That's all we need.

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:25.140
To go through it, so just release it as a CSV.

00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:33.180
And that's what they did, and they gave us a heads up, and I was like, oh, awesome, that, like, hey, because I worked at USCIS, I was able to even know about this data set that was coming down the pipeline.

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:39.400
And then it made me think, like, hey, I can actually use this to find the school for my son since my wife and I was looking for a while.

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:44.100
And then from that, my wife and I came up with just, like, a list of things that was really important to us.

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:54.640
And one of the things that was important to us, looking at the data sets and the data elements that they had, was making sure that my son had opportunities, equal opportunities as everybody else in that school for things like get their programs.

00:51:54.640 --> 00:52:11.160
Making sure that it was a diverse school, that it was a broad mix of diversity in the school, and making sure that, like, suspicion rates for, you know, black and brown people wasn't overly high compared to the actual population that was in the school.

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:25.140
And we wanted to compare that against all the different ethnicities that the CRDC had, and just making sure that not only for get-the-programs, for example, that it wasn't just black and brown kids have more of a chance of getting into these get-the-programs.

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:30.540
We went in a school that was super diverse, and, like, and everybody had an equal chance to get into these get-the-programs.

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:39.840
Because one thing we didn't want was, you know, in the case that if my son did get accepted to a get-the-program, that, like, his other friends wouldn't, because, like, the statistics showed that they probably won't be allowed.

00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:45.020
And we found this perfect school that was pretty much equal all around and super great for my son.

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:47.920
And that was how we came up with School Diversity Report.

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:54.020
And what's really cool about that was, so I presented that at staff, because I did it over, like, a couple of days as, like, a 20% project here at USDS.

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:57.140
Presented that at staff, showcased everybody, everybody loved it.

00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:05.400
And then from there, I actually ended up meeting the former Deputy Secretary of Education, James Cole, to just kind of present him with data and say, like, this is why data is important.

00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:12.500
And people like me can actually use this data to make cool tools that other people can use and can help make good decisions.

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:25.340
And one of the proudest things that, you know, why I felt like this was super successful was, so a couple of weeks ago, my son gets a letter from school saying he's been put into the advanced reading program at his school.

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:27.100
And I'm just really super excited about that.

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:30.300
And my wife works really, really hard, making sure he can read and all of that.

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:36.760
And when he's six years old, he reads all my text messages, which is, like, a consequence of, like, making sure he can read everything.

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:39.260
And he's just like, Daddy, like, what about this?

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:41.500
I'm like, stop reading my text messages.

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:44.340
Daddy, I know what your login password is.

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:45.800
Yeah, he does.

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:46.840
He does.

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:48.300
And he'll, like, wake me up.

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:49.220
He says, I know your password.

00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:49.920
I'm like, wait, what?

00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:53.080
It was really cool that he was getting able to accept this.

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:57.940
So one of the things I did when I originally built it, I built it in Node.js back in 2016.

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:05.540
It was Node.js Postgres and all these things on my local computer because hosting something on EC2 and RDS can get a little expensive sometimes for, like, a side project.

00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:09.180
So this year I kind of went to see since he got into that advanced reading program.

00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:12.980
Like, all right, now that this data has been updated, what are the stats now?

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:14.220
And still pretty equal.

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:16.140
I'm in this school, which is really, really good.

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:20.080
But then I end up saying, like, okay, well, how can I release this to the public, right?

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:25.440
And one of the ways I did that was saying, like, okay, well, how I'm doing this is pretty much a key value search, right?

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.720
This doesn't mean to have servers at all in it.

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:37.240
So I just use Python to kind of take the CSV and go mind by line and export the CSV to JSON files by zip code and school ID numbers.

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.380
So that way now it's all completely serverless, right?

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:43.180
Like, now it's on S3 and CloudFront, and I don't have to actually worry.

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:49.720
And for all your listeners, if you want to go to the site of school, diversityreport.com, and it should be able to scale, maybe we'll test out Amazon.

00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:50.880
That's good.

00:54:50.880 --> 00:55:07.300
But yeah, I'm really happy about that project and how, for me, I was able to even have that conversation with the dev secretary and say, like, this is why you should have open data with an agency because it's really important for us to have all that information as well.

00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:08.840
Yeah, it's a super cool project.

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:12.720
It's also beautiful, which I thought was really nice looking at.

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.200
Like, this is a really slick little website.

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:18.020
There's interesting insights in there.

00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:19.240
And like you said, it's fast.

00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:21.340
And yeah, I'll link to it in the show notes.

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:25.800
So if people want to check out their local schools or where they may be moving, then they can definitely use this.

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:26.180
That's great.

00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:28.280
Yeah, really excited for that project.

00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:29.400
And thank you.

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.420
I appreciate that you said it.

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:31.040
Nice looking.

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.700
Because I try to make everything as user-friendly as possible.

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:42.120
And I think that comes from my experience at USCIS is, like, making sure it's actually usable by people and not just, like, an engineer like me.

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:43.240
Yeah, exactly.

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:47.020
Not just Battleship Gray with, like, no CSS or whatever, right?

00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:47.960
It's really good.

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:48.360
Cool.

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.360
So, yeah, people will check it out.

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:54.660
You know, I feel like we're in this special place as having programming skills.

00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:57.580
It's almost like we're the modern-day magicians, right?

00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:02.620
Like, you're a guy who wanted to help his son get a better school, right?

00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:07.620
And then all of a sudden, like, well, this thing you built is like, well, I'm meeting the Deputy Secretary of Education in the U.S.

00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:13.060
because I conjured up this magic thing out of, like, what was already there, but nobody was using it, right?

00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:13.760
It's pretty cool.

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:18.400
I think for them, too, because sometimes they release this data and they have no idea what people are doing with it.

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:22.580
So just being able to showcase that, like, look, here's what people are doing with it was really cool.

00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:23.060
Absolutely.

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:26.400
So definitely people should check that out at schooldiversityreport.com.

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.920
All right, David, we're pretty much running out of our time here.

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:32.640
So I want to ask you two quick questions before we get out of here.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.340
First, if you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use?

00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:38.060
If I'm going to write some Python code, Sublime.

00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:46.620
I know people are switching to some other things like Atom and VS Code, but Sublime is just quick and easy, and I just love it.

00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:49.880
I love the fact that it opens up really quick, and I can open up large, like, CSV files.

00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:50.540
Yeah, it's cool.

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:54.380
It's definitely, I feel like, one of the originals of that genre.

00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:56.240
I don't know what to call that style of editor.

00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:00.900
It's not like a terminal-based one like Vim or Emacs, and it's definitely not an IDE.

00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:02.780
But there's other ones like it.

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:06.000
Like you said, like Sublime, Atom, VS Code.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.380
They're all kind of that gooey, lightweight gooey editors.

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:09.960
That's pretty cool.

00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:10.700
Yep.

00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:13.200
You come across, I'm sure, a ton of Python packages.

00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:21.140
If there's one out there that's notable that maybe people haven't heard of, or you just came across and thought that was pretty cool, you got any ones you want to give a shout-out to?

00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:22.680
Me outside of, like, Flask?

00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:29.260
You can do Flask if you want, but if there's something else that you think maybe, like, kind of delighted you or that people don't know about.

00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:32.660
I like some of the standard ones, like requests and important CSP.

00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:34.020
Pain is pretty cool.

00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:39.540
I think Flask is interesting because I feel like Flask is really becoming more popular.

00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:42.280
Like, it just tied Django as the most popular web framework.

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:50.840
But I think it's more interesting beyond that because all these other frameworks that are trying to be, like, the fresh new web thing.

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:54.040
I'm thinking Molten, Sanic, Black Sheep.

00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:58.260
Like, there's stuff that I haven't even, you know, just probably came out this week I haven't even heard of, right?

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:03.260
They almost all seem to adopt some flavor of Flask's API.

00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:05.480
So I feel like Flask is having a big impact.

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:08.880
Bigger than its credit, like its download credit or whatever.

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:13.340
Yeah, one thing I love about Python is there's a framework or a library for everyone and everything.

00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:15.420
That's, like, the most amazing thing about Python.

00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:17.660
It really is true.

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:19.360
All right.

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:22.720
There's that import anti-gravity XKCD cartoon, right?

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:26.000
And something for everyone and everybody and everything.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.240
Virtual environment is pretty cool to me.

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:28.640
Yeah.

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:29.260
There's a few.

00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:29.840
Yeah, cool.

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:30.960
All right.

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:33.440
Well, you know, this is super interesting.

00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:38.740
Like I said, I didn't know very much about USDS before, but I think it is a great idea.

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:42.420
And I have definitely heard of the effects you all have been having.

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:43.720
Like, I've heard of Hack the Pentagon.

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:47.540
I heard of the team that came in and fixed healthcare.gov.

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:50.280
And so I just didn't realize, like, that was all you guys.

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:50.700
That's cool.

00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:53.860
So maybe give folks a final call to action.

00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:54.780
Maybe they're interested.

00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:55.640
They want to learn more.

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.080
Maybe they want to come do a short tour of duty.

00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.020
And where do they start?

00:58:59.020 --> 00:58:59.360
Yeah.

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:02.540
If you're super interested, please go to USDS.gov slash supply.

00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:06.160
It's not like the other government forms where you have to go to USA jobs.

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.840
It's the same type of application you would do in the private industry.

00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:09.780
You upload your resume.

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:14.880
We have engineers or product people who, depending on what community practice you pick, but if

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:19.280
you're an engineer, we have engineers who actually do the resume reviews and the interviews.

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:22.420
And yeah, just go to USDS.gov slash supply.

00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:23.960
But this all sounds really interesting.

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:28.120
And you want to help the government in just a different capacity and just have tons of impact.

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:28.360
Yeah.

00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:28.640
Awesome.

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.480
Do you have to be a US citizen or permanent resident?

00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:32.840
You do have to be a US citizen.

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:33.220
Okay.

00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:34.560
Mainly because of the background check.

00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:35.000
Sounds good.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:35.280
All right.

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:36.740
Well, David, thank you for being on the show.

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:39.160
And thank you for all the good work you're doing for everyone.

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:40.320
This is pretty cool.

00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:41.300
Thank you for having me.

00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:45.700
And if all this is super interesting, we can have one of the engineers come on the show

00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:48.600
and talk about some of more in-depth into some of the projects they're working on.

00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:48.860
Yeah.

00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:49.400
Sounds like fun.

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:49.840
All right.

00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:50.320
Talk to you later.

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:50.840
Talk to you later.

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:54.460

Thanks so much for listening.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.740
I really appreciate it.

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:14.500
Now get out there and write some Python code.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:34.440
I'll see you next time.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:02:04.420
Thank you.
