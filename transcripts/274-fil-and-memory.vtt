Do you write data science code? Do you struggle loading large amounts of data or wonder what parts

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.880
of your code use the maximum amount of memory? Maybe you just want to require smaller compute

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.160
resources, servers, RAM, and so on. If so, this episode is for you. We have Itamar Turner-Trowing,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.940
Hey, Tamar. Welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.980
Hi, great to be here.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.380
Yeah, it's great to have you here. I'm excited to talk about Python and memory.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.140
Yeah, me too.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.680
Yeah, and I think it's something that doesn't really get as much coverage as I think it deserves in the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.360
Python space. You know, if you're a Java developer or a .NET developer, people go on and on and on about

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.260
optimizing the GC and tweaking this thing or that thing or your code or algorithms for memory management.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.560
If you're a C developer, you're constantly in fear of memory leaks and memory management. And in Python,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.780
we get it just kind of coast.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:18.380
Or not. And so my motivation for getting into this was doing some scientific computing with basically a giant pile of images,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.880
and we'd have to extract information from them. And I initially just focused on getting it working.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:37.260
And then one day, I said, Okay, we're running this on these cloud computers. And it's taking, you know, 18 hours to process the data. Like most of the CPUs are idle, because you're using so much memory. I wonder if this is a problem.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:53.500
And so I did some math, and I talked to management about our expected revenue. And it turns out we were going to spend like 70% of our expected revenue just on cloud computing, given my current implementation, which wouldn't have let any, there wouldn't be any left over for it.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.480
Were they excited about that? Or were they not so excited?

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:04.540
I didn't mention this. I went and optimized it. And then I just, like, then I sent emails to my manager saying, Look, look, look, the great work I did.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.480
Exactly.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.260
But I hadn't done any optimization.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's very, very cool.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:22.740
And so and reducing the memory, like meant that you could use a lot more CPUs, because that was the bottleneck initially. Like we had this cloud VM that was like mostly just sitting idle, because you just need so

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.720
much RAM for each of the threads or processes.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:41.140
Right. You can get a high memory version of a cloud computer, but it still, there is that tradeoff, right? You want to take full advantage of the CPUs there. And obviously, less memory is better. And also just it might mean fewer cloud computers to manage.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:58.880
Yeah. And if you think about your computer, if you look at like the usage of your computer, much of the time, your computer usage is going to be like you're using 1% of the CPU is just sitting there. And your RAM, if you're like, a lot of people say like a gigabytes of RAM, their computer, your RAM is going to be like three quarters percent full, 75% full.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:14.900
And basically, it's just that proportionally RAM is much more expensive than computing. And so you don't have as much of a just look at all the CPU guy, like memory tends to be resource constrained, and then the failure modes are you run out of memory and like your computer's wedged or you lost your data.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.420
Right, right. You run out of CPU, it goes slower.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.000
Yeah. So the failure modes are much worse.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:42.080
Interesting. Yeah, well, it's going to be really fun to dig into it. And I think it's an interesting angle of just the Python ecosystem that people don't spend that much time obsessing about the memory, but it's important. And it's interesting. And we're going to spend some time obsessing about it for the next hour. So for sure. Before we do, let's get into your story, though. How'd you get into programming a Python?

00:04:42.080 --> 00:05:09.200
I got into programming back in the mid 90s, and my parents were this business creating multimedia CD-ROMs, which was exciting new technology in the mid 1990s. And so I ended up just doing coding for them. I got into Python a few years later, when I discovered SOAP, the Z-O-P framework, which at the time was like really huge in the Python world. Like, you go to Python conferences, there'd be like a whole track on SOAP.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:20.360
And then I just stuck around and ended up using Python for lots of things like distributed computing, worked on Twisted for many years, and scientific computing, and just a variety of different things.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.460
Yeah, very cool. And what do you do day to day?

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:35.520
I've been doing training, stuff with Docker and packaging for Python. I'm hoping to eventually teach some stuff about Python memory, and then have some products, do a little consulting on the side and start thing.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.880
Yeah, very cool. Is this training in person? Is it online? What is it like?

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:53.940
Originally, this was in person training. I was supposed to have like, open enrollment class right after Taicon in Pittsburgh, for example. And nowadays, it's over Zoom. Because what do you do?

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:06.160
Yeah, because the world is crazy. It's absolutely crazy. Yeah. Okay. Well, cool. That's a lot of fun. I did that for like 10 years and really enjoyed my time doing in-person training. Luckily, there were no pandemics.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.440
Zoom actually works.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:18.360
It definitely got disrupted with other things, but not too much. Yeah, we did some stuff over, I think, GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, which there was no Zoom. So that's what we were using. It was pretty good, actually. Yeah, it's not a bad story.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:40.960
All right. So speaking of obsessing with Python memory, let's just get started off with a little bit of an overview of how Python memory works. So I feel like Python memory lives a little bit in between the C++ world, where it's very explicit, and the Java.net GC world, where it's not even deterministic. What's the story?

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:53.840
As a payload, this actually depends on which Python interpreter you're using. If you're using PyPy, P-Y-P-Y, it's actually basically like Java or .NET. If you're using CPython, which most people do, it's a little bit different.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:14.780
And the basic idea is that every Python object has a reference counter. And so when you get a reference to an object, it gets incremented by one. You remove a reference, it gets decremented. So when you append your object to a list, that's an extra reference. If you destroy the list, that reference goes down to...

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:22.040
If the reference goes down to zero, the object is not being used by anyone. There's no references to it. So it can immediately be freed up and deallocated.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:31.920
The problem with reference counting is that it's not... It doesn't cover all cases. If you have a circular... Set of circular references, the objects will never hit reference count to zero.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:41.800
So if you take a list and then you append it to itself, it's going... Because it has a reference to itself, its reference count is never going to hit zero, even if you don't have any other references to it.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:49.440
So in addition to the reference counting, Python also has a garbage collection system, which every... I think it's based on how many bytecodes have run.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:57.680
It will go and look for objects that are in this little loop by themselves, but not being used in any actual code and get rid of them too.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:04.940
Right. And I think the GC is also generational, like the other main ones, say Java and .NET as well.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.520
Yeah. And I don't quite remember how this works.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:27.780
So, you know, a totally, maybe more maniacal example might be if you're studying some kind of graph theory type object, like a network of things or a network of relationships among people or something like that, where it doesn't even have to be one thing pointing back at itself.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:34.220
It could be thing A points at B, B points at C and D, D points back at F, but F points at A.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:38.360
If you can make a circle following that chain, reference counting breaks.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.000
Yeah. And so then you fall back to GC, the garbage collection and...

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.640
Right. But I would say for the most part that just knowing the GC is there to kind of catch that edge case is really all most people need to know, right?

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.260
Because the primary story is this reference counting story. What do you think?

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.280
Unless you're using PyPy, because then there's no reference counting. It's only garbage collection.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:06.040
Yeah. But I'm thinking most people are running CPython. Maybe they're using some data science libraries, especially in the context of using your tool that we're going to talk about.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:16.120
It feels like it's definitely in the data science side of things. In that world, in the CPython world, then it's probably reference counting that you care the most about.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:26.840
Yeah. And I mean, just a fairly high level understanding that as long as something's referring to your object, it will exist. If the references go away, it will either immediately or eventually disappear and get deallocated.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.540
That's pretty much all you need to know the vast majority of the time.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:30.820
Yep.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.260
And the vast majority of time, that's enough, but not always.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:48.380
Not always. So we're going to talk about a project that you started called PhilFIL that is about profiling memory allocations for data pipeline type of scenarios in particular is optimized for that.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.400
Although I suspect you could use it for a lot of different things.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.340
I think so, yeah.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:57.540
But let's start the story by just talking about some memory challenges, I guess we could call them.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:06.460
So you wrote a cool blog post article called Clinging to Memory, How Python Function Calls Can Increase Your Memory Usage.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.060
Yeah.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.720
That's a pretty interesting one. Tell us the general idea here.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.260
And so this is something I encountered in the real world, so it can impact you.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:20.420
And this is more of an issue in the kind of applications where you're processing large amounts of data.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.200
So like one object might be like four gigabytes of RAM.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:33.460
Like if it's like, if objects live slightly longer and they're like, you know, a dictionary of three entries and there's only one dictionary, you don't really care how long it lives because it's not using.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:39.260
Are you using 2.7 or 2.701 megabytes for this working memory?

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:39.840
Nobody cares.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.060
Yeah.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:40.480
Yeah.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:46.120
When you have like an array that's like four gigabytes or 20 gigabytes, like this can have very significant impacts.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.660
If an array lives even slightly longer than it needs to.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:11:00.140
And so the idea is if you have a function and you create something in it and then you pass that object to another function that you're calling, you have function f and you're creating this.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.860
You have this large array, you pass it to g.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:08.660
If you have a local variable inside of f that the parent function still refers to that array.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.720
Like the parameter that accepted the data, for example.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.620
Yeah.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:18.660
Then that reference within that function call is a reference.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.440
It means reference count's not going to hit zero.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.980
Even if g like uses that array and then throws it away and doesn't care about it anymore.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.520
The parent function still has reference to that array.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:34.620
And so you can end up with these situations where if you read the code, you know that you are never going to use this data again.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.560
There is no way you can use it.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:47.480
But from Python's perspective, because there's a local variable, then the function frame that's referring to it, that object is going to persist until that function returns or if there was an exception that exits.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:47.840
Right.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.900
Because everything that was loaded up in that function got defined.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.580
And so here's all the variables of the function.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:58.200
And reference counting, they're still pointing at things until those variables go away, right?

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.140
And they go away when the function returns.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:00.760
Yeah.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:09.140
And you can imagine like if you go into PDB, like you can actually travel up and down the stack and like you can go up to like the parent function and see the local variables.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:09.800
They're still there.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:17.360
Like you can still go in the debugger prompt, just go up two frames to the parent caller and you'll still see the local variable pointing to your large object.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.540
And so you can restructure your code in various ways to deal with this.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:32.360
And the way I ended up actually doing it was basically copying this idiom from C++ where you have this object whose only job is to own another object.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.580
It has that.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:38.500
You end up with only one reference to the large area that you care about, which is from inside the owner object.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.540
Then you pass the owner object around.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:45.600
And when you know that you don't need that data anymore, you tell the owner object, clear your contents.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.040
And then that one reference goes away and memory is freed.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:13:00.640
So you sort of just interesting situation where every once in a while you actually have to fall back to the manual memory management techniques that you have to use all the time in languages like C or C++.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.240
Right.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.120
You know what's interesting is I see examples of code like this.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:10.100
And then you'll see other people lamenting the fact that code is written this way.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.420
And they'll say, you should never write code this way.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.060
It's not necessary in Python because it has automatic memory management.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:22.480
Or you should never do this like halfway through randomly set a variable to none and then keep going.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.500
Why would you ever do that?

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.280
That's like you don't need to do that.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:25.540
Right.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.760
If you're not going to use it again.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:32.060
Oh, except when that was costing you an extra gig of memory.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:37.100
All of a sudden, this kind of nonstandard pattern, it turns out to be really valuable.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:37.440
Right.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:43.080
It's the difference between it works or it doesn't work or it's a thousand versus two hundred dollars a cloud compute or whatever.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.360
Right.

Yeah.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:15:01.340
Having never done scientific computing before this job I was at a couple years ago, it was an interesting experience learning a different – because the domain is different, like you have different constraints and different goals, and some of the ways you write software end up being different.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:08.820
Unless you're doing large-scale data processing most of the time in Python, you just don't think of any of these things.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:25.100
Like, you might have to worry about memory leaks, but that's a different sort of – much of the time, that's a different set of problems, where, like, you don't think about the fact that an object being alive for five more milliseconds might cost you, like, another $100,000 if you're scaling up.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.860
Yeah, for sure.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:27.620
It's interesting.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.860
Another solution that you proposed – well, you proposed three solutions.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.800
One is this ownership story.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:44.580
One was maybe only applicable for very limited small functions, but you could just have no local variables and just basically chain one function call into another.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:44.900
Yeah.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:51.020
The intermediate one, though, seems possible, possibly reasonable as well, which is to reuse the local variable.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:55.980
So you're going to load up some data, and then you're going to maybe make some changes, which will copy the data.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:03.240
Instead of having data one, data two, data three, you just say data equals load it, data equals modify the data, data equals modify the data again.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:10.300
And that way, at least as you go through these steps, after each one, it's, you know, released the memory from the prior, potentially.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:10.620
Yeah.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:18.140
And one of the things about sort of data processing applications, they often have these sort of idioms where you're, like, doing a series of steps.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:26.720
And this is where, like, keeping old copies of the data around tends to end up cumulatively being very expensive in terms of memory because it's a series of steps.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.420
Once you've done step one, you don't really care about the initial input.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.800
Once you've done step two, you don't care about that one.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.740
So just explicitly overriding the previous step is another way to do this.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.040
I can see somebody looking at this in a code review and going, why are you doing this?

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.880
These data mean different things.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.520
One should be initial data.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.820
The other should be, you know, grouped by state.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.660
And the third should be some other thing.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:49.960
Like, you're naming these wrong.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.360
You know what I mean?

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:57.980
That's what I was kind of hinting at is, like, sometimes you need to break the rules to break through to, like, a better outcome.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:58.300
Yeah.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:03.460
And in general, pretty much every best practice is very situation-specific.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.340
And sometimes it's the vast majority.

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.060
But...

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.640
Yeah, that's a really good point.

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:12.360
A lot of times when you hear advice like that, it's spoken as if it was absolute.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.680
But there's an implicit context, right?

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.320
Like you said, when you don't really care about memory and that kind of stuff, you just said you just go and write the code.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:25.320
But, you know, it probably means implicitly what I care about is readability.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.500
And what I care about is maintainability.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:32.920
And I just want to optimize it to be as clean and pure as possible, which is fine.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:37.020
But if pure doesn't work and not clean totally works, like, forget the clean.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:37.760
We don't care anymore.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.460
I want it to work.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.300
That's more important.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.540
Like, functioning is primary here.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:41.860
Yeah.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:46.880
And then there's, like, places like MicroPython where you're running on little embedded devices with very little RAM.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:53.260
And then some of the problems that you have in large data processing are translated down to very small programs.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:18:01.660
That's an interesting example for sure because, again, if you didn't care about that extra meg of RAM, but all of a sudden you only have half a meg, now you really care about it.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:01.880
Yeah.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:06.480
I do want to throw out something from Philip Guo over at pythontutor.com.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:12.620
So if you want to understand, like, a lot of these relationships and how objects refer back to each other, he's got a really cool visualization.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.580
I think when you're over there, you have to check.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.540
There's, like, a checkbox at the bottom.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.340
Let me pull it up.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.060
Under the way it renders objects, I think you have to flip it.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:28.600
From inline primitives to, say, render all objects on the heap like Java and Python do.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.940
Anyway, if you want to, like, show that off or visualize that, that's a really cool quick one.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:39.960
Also, if you want to observe reference counting without changing reference counting.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.860
Because, like, you might want to say, how do I know if there's a reference to this?

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:48.920
You can't store a variable and point at it and say, now we're going to ask because you've now changed it, right?

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.100
Have you done anything with weak references?

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.400
Weak ref?

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.000
I'm not sure I've ended up using them in scientific computing.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.620
I've definitely done them and used them in some places with, like, asynchronous programming servers.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:03.460
Yeah.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:08.440
Yeah, you could use them for, like, caches that can kind of, like, auto expire and stuff as well.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.500
But they're really good for, I could create a weak reference to an object.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.800
Then you can ask, how many things point at this?

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:20.240
And even if you know something points at it, knowing whether that's one or two might help you get a different understanding, right?

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.720
You're like, oh, I thought there was only one pointer.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.380
Why are there two pointers to this thing?

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.300
Where did that second one come from?

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:30.400
And so you can ask interesting questions without changing the reference counting with weak references.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.040
It's really easy.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:31.220
Yeah.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:31.840
Yeah.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.980
And there's an API, sys.get refers.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.500
It gives you the objects that refers to an object.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:43.240
But then, yeah, you inevitably add the current function frame as an additional reference, and you have to discount it.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:43.880
Right, right.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.420
You threw also get size of in here as well.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.000
What's the story of the get size of?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.800
The function call thing is sort of just an example of places where sort of automatic memory management gets in your way.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:06.080
But there are more fundamental limits or problems you end up with when using Python in memory intensive situations, which you need to understand.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:13.580
And one of them is just that Python objects use a surprising amount of memory for what information that they store.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:22.380
So pretty much every, if you look at the implementation of the CPython interpreter, every object has an addition to whatever data you need to actually store the object itself.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:30.580
It has, on a 64-bit machine, which is most of them these days, it has a pointer to the class or the C type for the class.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.680
So that's another eight bytes.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.580
And then it has the reference count.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.380
So that's another eight bytes.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:39.080
And I think if you have, if it's object sports garbage collection, it's even more.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:48.640
And so if you check the system get size of as a nice utility that lets you use, tell me, tell you how many bytes object uses.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.420
I don't think that actually traverses the object tree, right?

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.540
Like if this thing, if it's a list and the list points at things and those points at those.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.020
Yeah.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:04.460
I think it's just how much is like that, the immediate thing that that variable value points at, right?

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:04.800
Yeah.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.320
Yeah.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:05.460
Okay.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.520
That's what I thought.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.340
Yeah.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.360
I can check what you're talking.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:16.240
And if you check the, how much memory, like an integer uses, like the number one, it takes 28 bytes.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:16.640
Yeah.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:27.500
So if you think about like how you'd represent numbers in memory, like unless you have really large numbers where you obviously need more, 64 bits is sort of, will get you some really big numbers.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:49.080
So if you're using a list with a million integers, that's way like I did the math and I think it was 35, a list with a million integers in it is 35 megabytes of RAM.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.560
If you allocated that in a CRA, it would be eight megabytes of RAM.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:57.300
So you're using four and a half times as much memory just because you're using Python objects.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:06.280
In another example, while we're talking about it is the character A. So in C, the character A would be what, four bytes or something like that?

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.180
If you're using UTF-8, you can probably get it down to one byte.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.580
Yeah. Yeah. You could definitely make it smaller if you do it right.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.060
Yeah.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:12.980
In Python, it's 50.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.260
Yeah.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:25.600
So also get size of, it does some interesting stuff. So if I give it a list of like a million items, it'll say the size is 800,000. It's not quite a million. Maybe it's 100,000. I think it's 100,000.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:38.480
But if I give it a list, which has the number one and also contains within that list, that list of 100,000 items, the size is 72. So yeah, you got to be real careful. It's, it's, it doesn't tell you the whole story, but it does.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:50.220
Yeah, exactly. But it gives you a sense of, oh, like the letter A is 50 and the number one is 28. The memory that we use per representation and data in Python is fairly expensive, I think is the takeaway, right?

00:22:50.220 --> 00:23:05.120
Yeah. So if you have like a common, one place where people hit this is like, you're reading in some data and then like you're creating like a list per thing for like a reading in some like rows of data from the CSV or something.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:12.180
And you're turning into like, here's a list and then like there's a dictionary with like a bunch of keys for each one or an object for each entry.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:22.300
And you end up with like a massive amount of, considering the information you're storing, you end up with a huge amount of just overhead from creating all those different Python objects.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:31.080
And so like one situation you end up in Python running out of memory is if you're doing like data processing and it's just like, you just have 10 gigabytes of data you loaded.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:40.300
It's going to be a lot of memory, but sometimes it's not actually that much data if you store it on disk or if you store it in the appropriate CXC object.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.140
And it's just a lot of data because you create a lot of Python objects.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.040
And so it's using like five times as much memory as the actual information.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:55.420
Right, right. So maybe load it into NumPy or Pandas or something like that instead of into a native Python dictionary or something.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:59.800
Yeah. So if you think about Python lists, which has a bunch of Python integers in it.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:04.980
And so each of those Python integers has like 28 bytes of RAM.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:12.100
A NumPy array, it's basically has the same Python overhead, but only once at the beginning where it says, I'm an array.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.660
And I store 64-bit integers.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:19.400
And then the storage is just, it's not a generic pointer to generic Python.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.620
Right, right. It's eight bytes per entry.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:22.060
Yeah.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:27.640
Yeah. And so the information that would take 35 megabytes in a Python list will be eight megabytes in a NumPy array.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:34.420
Yeah. Another one that, I mean, moving to some of these libraries that support it more efficiently, certainly in the data science world make a lot of sense.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:43.600
But also something that makes a lot of sense that I think people may be overlooking is using different algorithms or different ways of processing.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:49.600
Like one really simple way is like I need to load, compute a bunch of stuff and give it back as a collection.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.700
So I'm going to create a list, fill it up and return it. Right.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:57.140
That loads, you know, maybe a million items in a memory and all the cost and overhead of that.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.960
And then you give it over to be processed and off it goes.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:06.520
Alternatively, add a yield instead of a list and just do a generator and you process them one at a time.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.540
Because probably what you're going to do when you get that list back is go through the list one at a time. Right.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.940
And that uses one one millionth of the memory or something to that effect. Right.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.200
It doesn't, it only loads one in memory at a time and not all of them.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.640
There's things like that as well that you can do.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.140
Yeah.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.720
If processing them one at a time in order makes sense.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.260
If you need to seek around and say, well, what the third one compared to the first one is, then forget it.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:28.460
Yeah.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:36.860
Like the three basic techniques usually are batching and streaming with that generator is like a sort of batches of one.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:37.440
A size of one.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:37.760
Yeah.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:38.200
Yeah.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:46.740
And then there's compression where you have the same memory and same data semantically, but with less overhead.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:50.040
So like switching from Python lists to NumPy arrays in some sense compression.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:56.720
If you know your numbers are only going to go up to 100, you can use a 8-bit NumPy array.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:02.960
And then like you've cut your memory by like 80% at no cost because you have exact same information.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.700
And then the final technique is indexing where you need to load only some of the data.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.460
Then you can sort of arrange your data.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.060
So you can only, you only need to load that part.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:20.700
So like if you're doing accounting, like if you have one file for every month of the year, like you can just load July's file and then you don't have to worry about the data in the other months.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.080
Yeah.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:21.440
Yeah.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.420
Very cool summary.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.360
So that's the picture.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.580
That's the memory story.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:31.480
That's some of the challenges you might hit and some of the potential solutions that you might come up against.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:38.220
But at some point you might just need to know like, okay, this is about as good as it's going to get, but I still need to understand the memory better.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.740
Or I'm running out of memory.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:40.880
Why?

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.780
Where?

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.020
Or maybe you want to take the lazy approach.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:48.780
Maybe you want to start from, well, I know I have this problem of using too much memory.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:55.740
I know one of these things that these guys talked about will possibly solve it, but where should I focus my attention?

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:55.980
Right.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.280
I've got a thousand lines of Python.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.260
Maybe only three need to be changed.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.180
Which are the three?

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.100
Right.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.720
So you probably want to profile it somehow.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.660
Answer the question, like where is the memory coming from?

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.740
What's the problem?

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.720
It's very difficult to optimize something if you can't measure it.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:15.720
Like the example we gave with functions keeping local variables, keeping things alive.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:21.300
Like I would never, now that I know it's a problem I've encountered, I might be able to look for it.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:27.580
But at time, like it was, I believe it was something like extra 10 gigabytes of RAM or something.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:31.300
And I don't think I ever would have spotted it just by reading the code.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:31.580
Yeah.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.760
Because it looks perfect.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.460
It's clean.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:34.140
It's readable.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:38.760
It's optimized exactly for the scenario that you most of the time optimize it for.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.860
So it doesn't look broken.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:40.160
Yeah.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.520
If you want to understand why something is using too much resources, like you need to measure it.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:55.340
I built a profiler for a memory profiler called Phil, Phil, F-I-L, which is designed to solve this problem because I hadn't tried other tools available.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.580
I decided they weren't sufficient.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:56.980
Yeah.

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.960
So Phil, I think is really interesting.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:06.160
And the thing that made it connect for me at first, I was like, well, we already have some pretty interesting ones.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.880
I mean, you've got built-in C profile.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.560
I think that only does CPU profiling, not memory.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.880
We have memory underscore profiler, which will do memory profiling.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.500
Yeah.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.200
We have Austin.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.060
Yeah.

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:17.360
Yeah.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:17.560
Yeah.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.240
We have Austin.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.160
Are you familiar with Austin?

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.300
I've not used it.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:27.360
I've used a Pi instrument and I know about Pi top, Pi spy, and they're all sampling profilers.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:27.780
Right.

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:28.040
Right.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.060
And Austin's pretty interesting as well.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:40.400
But Phil, the way that you laid it out is really a lot of these profilers are either general purpose or they're built around the idea of working on servers.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:45.480
And long living processes that do short amounts of work many, many times.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:45.820
Right.

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.760
Like a web server or something like that.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.780
And that's a pretty different scenario of I have a script.

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:56.920
I need to run it once in order and then look at where the memory comes from.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.120
Right.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:57.380
Yeah.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:02.080
So memory profiler is the tool I ended up using when I was trying to use memory usage.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:10.940
And memory profiler will do this thing where it gives you, like you write on a function that says this function added 10K in memory or 100 megabytes in memory or whatever.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.460
And if you're trying to find a memory leak, this is actually pretty useful.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.620
Like you can say, like I call this function, now my memory usage higher.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.960
And so what happened?

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.500
So you can just figure out this function is where your memory is leaking.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:31.780
But the thing that I was trying to do and what data processing applications, as you mentioned, are trying to do is reduce your peak memory.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:35.140
The idea is that you're running this process.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.420
It's going to load in some data.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:37.460
It's going to process it.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.400
And then it's going to write it out.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.020
And it's going to exit.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:45.060
And the peak memory usage is what determines how much hardware you need or virtual hardware.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:53.020
Like it doesn't matter if like 99% of the time it's only using 100 megabytes, if 1% of the time it needs 60 gigabytes of RAM.

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.720
Like it's that peak moment in time that you need to.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.080
That's what you have to put it in for.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:58.360
Yeah.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:58.740
Yeah.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.560
The high watermark.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.980
It's like you're building a dam.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.220
Like you figure out what the highest flood you get is.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:12.180
And the thing about memory profiler, like you can run it on your function and it'll say this line of code added zero megabytes of RAM.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.800
Like it measured before, measured after.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.540
They're the same.

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.400
So no memory was added.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.440
But that doesn't tell you.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.820
It's fine, right?

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.580
Right.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:25.620
But it may be that it allocated 20 gigabytes of RAM, did something, and then deallocated.

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:38.780
And so you have to, the memory profiler, like recursively go through your whole code base function by function until you find that one line of code that's spiking things.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:45.400
And so you can use it to figure out the peak memory, but it is a very manual, tedious process.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.020
Yeah.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:51.420
And once your code base is hard enough, it can become quite difficult.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:56.960
And another big distinction between servers and data pipelines is how much you care about memory leaks.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:05.360
As long as it's a small memory leak, like if you're doing like a process that runs for an hour and it leaked 100k, like after an hour, it'll just exit.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:14.000
If you have, if you're leaking 100k an hour, but your process, you have like 10 processes and they're running for a year, 100k may still not be a problem.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.560
But like there are some thresholds where for a server, like it accumulates and your server crashes.

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:22.640
And for a batch process, so long it's not impacting the peak, you don't care.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:22.840
Right.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:31.820
Well, imagine you leak only one kilobyte of memory, but it's in the context of a web request and you're getting 100,000 web requests an hour.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.120
All of a sudden, your server is toast, right?

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:41.760
Whereas if you call the function once and you leak a kilobyte and you're doing like a top to bottom run at once data pipeline, who cares?

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.160
Doesn't matter, right?

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.700
It's lost in the void there.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:50.620
So I think also just the focus of what you care about is really different.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.640
You don't generally have these huge spikes in server type applications.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:32:00.740
You can if you're doing like reporting or other weird stuff, but like standard data driven stuff, it's pretty flat line.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.120
Yeah.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:08.600
And it turns out that if you think about it, a memory leak, a tool that can find peak memory can also find memory leaks.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:13.120
Because if you have a memory leak, peak memory is always like right now.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.040
Yeah, exactly.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:18.520
If you just run for a while and peak memory, eventually like your memory is overwhelmed by the leak.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.660
And then you dump the memory then.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.840
And so that moment is peak memory.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:28.660
So a tool that can find peak memory can deal with leaks, but it deals with leaks can't necessarily help you with peak memory.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.260
So it's actually a more general concept.

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:36.120
Talk Python To Me is partially supported by our training courses.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.100
How does your team keep their Python skills sharp?

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:43.240
How do you make sure new hires get started fast and learn the Pythonic way?

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:52.240
If the answer is a series of boring videos that don't inspire or a subscription service you pay way too much for and use way too little, listen up.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:56.140
At Talk Python Training, we have enterprise tiers for all of our courses.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:33:00.700
Get just the one course you need for your team with full reporting and monitoring.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:08.420

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:22.440
Another thing I like to do is relate quantum mechanics back to programming ideas.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:26.940
And I think they're really relevant in both profiling and debugging.

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:35.440
And that is the idea I'm thinking of is the observer effect, that by observing some phenomenon, you might actually change it, right?

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.240
Maybe the tool you're using to measure it actually makes some difference.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:43.960
Or in quantum mechanics, like just insane, bizarre observer effect.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.520
Things happen that, again, shouldn't, but it does.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:55.200
One of the challenges I see around profiling is, especially instrumenting style profilers,

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:59.960
is you run it because it's too slow, you won't understand the performance.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.120
So you apply the profiler to it.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:06.440
Now it's 10 times slower or 20 times slower, but not evenly, right?

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:13.580
Like if it's in a really tight loop, that part slows down more than if you're calling like a C function that you're not technically profiling that part,

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:14.500
but it's still slow.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.840
That might not really slow down at all.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.460
So you might exaggerate different parts of it as well.

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:23.060
And it sounds to me like Phil doesn't have much of this observer problem.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:23.320
Yeah.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:34.640
So the observer problems tend to be worse in CPU profiling, because as you said, like the act of profiling can change how fast the process runs or which parts of the code run faster.

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:39.500
So C profile suffers from this, because it's adding overhead per Python function.

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:46.500
And so code that has a lot of Python functions will be slower than code that has less Python functions, even if the actual runtime is the same.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.420
So the ads are already unevenly.

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:51.980
And the solution on the hand CPU profile is actually sampling.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:55.980
We only like every thousand times a second, you see what's running right now.

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:59.700
And tools, I believe Austin works that way and PySpy and PyInstrument.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:00.060
All right.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.500
It's more like a helicopter parent.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.200
Like, what are you doing?

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:03.760
What are you doing?

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.560
What are you doing?

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.000
Instead of actually walking along every step, just constantly asking.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.020
Yeah.

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:12.480
And so then it gets a chance to run faster or whatever when it's not asking.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:12.660
Yeah.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.820
The impact is quite minimal.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:21.940
And because slower CPU functions will show up more when you're just peaking every once in a while, like statistically it'll converge.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:31.500
You'll get an overview of where performance is being spent that isn't exactly right, but it's close enough that it doesn't matter that it's not exact.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.820
So that's CPU.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:38.940
In memory, sampling might work well for something like a memory leak.

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:43.920
Because with a memory leak, like eventually all your memory usage is this one function being called over and over.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.360
So if you only check some of the time, it's like eventually you'll catch it.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:59.120
But if you care about the peak, you have to maybe not have to capture all the allocations, but like you may have like one specific allocation that's like 20 gigabytes.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.500
That's what causes your peak.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:06.460
And if your sampling doesn't catch it, then the sampling, the profiling is useless.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:13.500
And so effectively, one way or another, you have to track every memory allocation if you actually want to find peak memory.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:26.960
So the implementation approach, whereas sampling is like the superior approach for CPU, if you will care about a high watermark or peak memory, instrumentation is often the only way to go.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.580
If you have uneven allocation patterns, which is the case in data processing applications.

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:31.940
Right.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:32.840
Yeah.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.940
And it sounds like maybe a 50% speed hit is what the docs say.

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.000
That doesn't sound too bad.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:38.120
Yeah.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:43.440
I mean, it's probably slower in some cases and faster than others.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.920
This is what you like if you run PyStone.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:45.260
Yeah.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.420
It's not like a thousand percent or something like that.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:47.620
Right.

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:47.980
Yeah.

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:54.420
And I spent basically, once your profile is slow enough, people just don't use it because they don't have the patience.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:54.800
Yeah.

00:36:54.900 --> 00:37:02.460
So a lot of the effort I put, like, the basic idea of what it does is not that sophisticated.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:06.900
It's basically, like, you intercept all memory allocations and keep track.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:12.080
And then whenever you hit a new peak, you store a copy of that so that you know that's the peak.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:16.340
It's just if you want to do that with low overhead, that takes work.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:16.740
Right.

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.120
Absolutely.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:28.620
So one of the challenges is the reason you're using the profiler probably is because you have a lot of data and you built it in some small scenario and then you run it in the real scenario, then it actually is not doing as well as you'd hoped.

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:32.220
That's exactly when you need to be able to run it with the profiler.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:36.600
And you need it to work fast, I guess is what I'm saying, to really use it in real scenarios.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:36.940
Yeah.

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:43.980
And another thing I've done to handle that, which, and this is a new project, so this is all, like, work in progress.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:52.620
But I know at least, like, I've gotten at least one success story of someone saying they found a, like, in within minutes, they found a memory issue they wouldn't have found otherwise.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:56.280
So I know it's useful for some people and other people have bugs.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:04.540
But another feature that I've added is when the worst case scenario for running out of memory is your program just crashes.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:09.680
And this can be as bad as, like, your computer just wedges altogether, which is not uncommon.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:19.040
Like, just everything's become so utterly slow that, like, yes, if you left it alone for a day, it'd come back, but you put files to restart it.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.960
Or you get, like, or it just crashes.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.260
And you can do a core dump, but, like, the core dump doesn't tell you.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:25.180
In theory, it has information you want.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.560
Yeah, in practice, that's a whole other level right there.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:28.860
Yeah.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:32.660
Or it actually does not have the information you want, to come to think of it.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:39.460
Another thing, a feature I've added is Phil makes some attempts to handle out-of-memory crashes.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:49.200
Like, if you run out of memory, it'll say, like, okay, you just got a failed allocation, so I'm going to try to deallocate all the large allocations that I know about just to free up some memory.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:55.320
And it has, like, this emergency stash of, like, 16 megabytes that, like, just allocates up front and select it.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.360
It breaks the glass.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.040
It allocates that memory, so it's a bit more.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.920
It lets it go and then starts tearing stuff down as hard as it can.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:01.040
Yeah.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.600
And then it tries to dump a report of, like, this is what your memory usage was.

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.880
And it won't always work, and I suspect it needs a bunch more work.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:13.360
Like, it needs a bunch of optimization, because I feel it dumping the report from field text memory.

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:24.400
But the idea, like, my goal, at least, is that when you run out of memory, instead of just a crash, you'll actually get some feedback that will help you diagnose the problem.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.700
Yeah, that's really, really cool.

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:32.620
I don't know how CPython, a Cprofile, excuse me, I don't know exactly how deep its reach is.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:48.240
But in Cprofile, if I'm trying to look at, say, data science stuff, and I'm calling a library, and it's using its internal malloc and its internal C stuff to manage the memory down in the C layer, I don't know if Cprofile will check that.

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:53.940
You know, if it's doing, like, crazy Fortran stuff or other allocations, who knows?

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:57.320
So CPprofile, I mean, it's giving you CPU, but it's...

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.420
Yeah, I'm sorry, Memory Profiler, the one that does memory one.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:00.840
Yeah, yeah.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:09.700
So Python actually has a memory profiler thing, TraceMalloc, but it only knows about Python memory APIs.

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:12.920
Like, if you're using an arbitrary C++ library, you won't know about it.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.900
Which is common in the data science world, right?

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.820
I mean, that's exactly where a lot of the action is.

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:17.140
Yeah.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:23.080
Yeah, Memory Profiler has a bunch of different ways it can work, but it can actually...

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:29.840
The most general way it works is, like, at the beginning of the line of code, the end of the line of code, it checks just how much memory that process is using.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:35.700
And so it'll work with any allocation, but it has the other downsides that we talked about earlier.

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:38.060
So Memory Profiler can actually...

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:43.160
The reason I was using it was because it can actually catch any allocation from any C library.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.180
I see.

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:47.840
Painfully, for purposes of reducing memory usage.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.720
Yeah, for sure.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:41:00.140
And so my goal with Phil was to not just be tied to Python code allocations and be able to just generically support anything that any third-party library is using.

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:03.960
Yeah.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:04.960
Yeah.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:05.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:06.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:08.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:13.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:14.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:15.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:18.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:19.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:20.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:21.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:22.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:23.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:24.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:26.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:28.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:30.960
I think that's a lot of things that I've done.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.960
I think that I've done.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:36.960
because the operating system will cleverly load and unload stuff from disk on demand.

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:41.960
And so it is affecting how much memory you use, but the OS will sort of optimize it for you.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.960
So it's not clear how to measure it.

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:48.960
So there's a lot of ways that if you want to track everything, like there's a lot of them,

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.960
and I don't do all of them quite yet.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:57.960
But I've been sort of adding them one by one and hope to cover the vast majority of cases pretty soon.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.960
Yeah, but you covered some of these at least already, huh?

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:01.960
Yeah.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:10.960
I cover basic MF usage, malloc, calloc, realloc, which I said, the standard APIs, added aligned alloc, which is C++.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:16.960
Apparently, at least in some cases, Fortran, I've never done anything with Fortran.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.960
I just know that it's a thing that scientific computing uses.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.960
And so like I said, okay, I'm going to figure out if Fortran is covered by this.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:28.960
And it turns out that traditionally Fortran never actually had memory allocation.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:34.960
You would just like write some code and you would say, I'm going to have this array and that's all you ever got.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:38.960
But modern Fortran from 1990 onwards has explicit allocation.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:43.960
And Phil can at least capture that if you use at least GCC's Fortran compiler.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:51.960
And so the idea is you should be able to just take arbitrary data processing or scientific computing code and it will figure out those allocations.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:59.960
It won't tell you like which line of Fortran and which line of C was responsible because that's like there are tools that do that.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.960
But the performance overhead is immense.

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:07.960
But it will tell you at least which line of Python was responsible and much of the time that's sufficient.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.960
Right. And as a Python developer, really, that's kind of the answer you want.

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.960
You don't want to know that like this internal part of NumPy did it.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:18.960
You just want to know I called, you know, load CSV on Pandas or something.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.960
And that's where the memory is or something.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:20.960
Yeah, exactly.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.960
You want to see the kind of boundary into that library because that's where you control.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:26.960
You're not going to go rewrite Pandas or NumPy.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.960
Yeah.

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:28.960
And yeah, much of it.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:41.960
So yeah, you will like the goal field is to tell you where in your Python code the memory usage was and not only tell you that in a very easy to understand way, which was another one of my goals.

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:45.960
Yeah. So you want to tell people maybe describe the flame graphs that they can see and explore.

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:46.960
Yeah.

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.960
And maybe we can link to one of the show notes.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:52.960
So flame graph, I think Brendan Gregg came up with the idea.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:44:02.960
And the idea is it's sort of showing you, you know, your programs that you can think of as a, any point you have like a call stack, like you have function F calls function Z calls function H.

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.960
That's sort of a stack.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:10.960
And so you can put these bars that where the wider they are, the more resource they're using.

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.960
Brendan Gregg originally did this for CPU.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:13.960
I'm using it for memory.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:21.960
And the idea is so if you have a really wide, like if you have a bar that's like 100% of the screen, that's like it's things using all this or the functions of call.

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:22.960
They're using all your memory.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.960
If it's like narrower, it's using less memory.

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.960
And then I've arranged it in a way that it actually includes the source code.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.960
So what you're reading looks like a stack trace.

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.960
It looks like like something through an exception and you're just reading it.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:40.960
But the width of the bar shows you which lines of code were responsible for how much memory cumulatively.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:47.960
I also added some stuff where there's a building on a Rust library called Inferno, which is great, which didn't much of the heavy lifting.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:53.960
But I added a feature to Inferno where the wider the bar, the more memory it's using, the redder it is.

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:58.960
And so the idea is you just look at the graph and you can just see like where it's red is where.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:44:59.960
Where is it red?

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:00.960
That's the problem.

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:01.960
That's the thing you got to focus on, right?

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:02.960
Yeah.

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.960
It really focuses on the expensive parts of the code.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.960
And then what you're reading is a stetress.

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:08.960
Yeah.

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:09.960
And these are cool.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:17.960
You can embed these into the web pages and then you can hover over them and click and like zoom into the functions and really explore it quick and easy, right?

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:18.960
Yeah.

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:26.960
I originally rolled this sort of Perl script that converted data into these SVGs and then Inferno library ported that to Rust and so I'm using it.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.960
So they didn't much of the work and I'm just building on top of it mostly.

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.960
So they did a few small features.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:33.960
Yeah.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.960
It's like this whole UI for exploring there.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:36.960
To use it is super simple.

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:47.960
Like if you were going to run Python space your app.py with its arguments, you just would replace Python with fill dash profile space run and that's it, right?

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:48.960
And you get this output.

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:48.960
Yeah.

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:51.960
My goal was also no options.

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:56.960
Like this isn't a people don't run memory profiling like every day.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:02.960
Like it's not like a tool you want to tweak and customize your own personal needs or that you want to spend a lot of time learning.

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.960
So another of my goals is just it should just work.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:11.960
So I've at the moment it has one command line option, like where it dumped the data, you know, you need to set that or think about it.

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:17.960
And then the output is like a HTML page that has the graphs embedded and has some explanations.

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:23.960
And so the goal is as much as possible to make it as sort of transparent and easy to use.

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:28.960
And I have some further ideas of how to improve the UX, which I haven't gotten to yet.

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:29.960
Nice.

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:39.960
So if I'm like a data scientist or a computing person who is not necessarily a programmer, I could just drop in here, pip install, fill, fill dash profile, run my thing that normally I would just say Python run.

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.960
And that's, that's all I really got to know.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.960
And then I just look at a web page.

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:44.960
Yeah.

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:46.960
It'll open the web page automatically if you're, it can.

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:47.960
So you don't even have to.

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:48.960
Yeah.

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.960
If you're, the goal is you run it and it, yeah.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:51.960
Yeah.

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:55.960
If you're, the goal is you run it, it pops up a web page, read the web page and you have the answer.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:56.960
Yeah.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:57.960
What's using where memory is going.

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:06.960
You spoke about one of the cool features being the out of memory catch and analysis, and you've got to do a slightly different thing on the command line to make that work.

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:06.960
Right?

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:07.960
Yeah.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:11.960
The issue is, and this is a thing I can probably fix eventually.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.960
It's just, this is sort of a limit in my implementation.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.960
The code that generates the report right now is in Python.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:20.960
And if you just run out of memory, you can't go back into Python at that point.

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:21.960
Yeah.

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.960
So if you run out of memory, like it's not, the experience isn't quite as nice.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:33.960
Eventually I might end up like, if it reaches the point where I'm not like iterating it as quickly, I might rewrite that in Rust.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:39.960
And then at that point, it might be feasible to actually like have the fully nice UI and the crash.

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:39.960
Yeah.

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:40.960
Right.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:41.960
Okay, cool.

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:46.960
Now also currently it runs on POSIX, Linux and macOS only, right?

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:47.960
Yeah.

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:48.960
I would expect that.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.960
I'm not sure it would run on anything other than like, if you run this in FreeBSD, my guess is it will work.

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:53.960
Yeah.

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:54.960
But I don't think-

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:55.960
Linux and macOS, yeah.

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:56.960
Yeah.

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:56.960
Yeah.

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.960
I don't think data scientists or scientists are using much FreeBSD.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:47:59.960
Right.

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:00.960
Yeah.

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:04.960
And macOS was added fairly recently.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:18.960
And someday I would like to add Windows, but it's, there's a lot of like dealing with like linkers and like fairly low level details that I don't know as much about on Windows.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:19.960
So it should be possible.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.960
I've seen things that make that make me think that it is possible.

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:27.960
I just, it's a chunk of work I haven't done too, because they're hard.

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:28.960
Sure.

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:29.960
Yeah.

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:31.960
You've either got to get it working or-

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:32.960
Yeah.

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.960
You're just supporting macOS, because that's a lot of work, so.

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:35.960
Yeah.

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:36.960
Yeah.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:37.960
I'm sure it was.

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:41.960
So I actually think that maybe you don't have to worry too much about Windows.

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.960
And that's not to say that people don't use Windows.

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:49.960
Windows is used by like half the Python developers, and it's probably pretty heavy in the data science world as well.

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:55.960
But, you know, Windows 10 now has Windows subsystem for Linux, and V2 is quite nice.

00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:00.960
So it's very possible you can just point people at, you know, you have to use Windows subsystem for Linux.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:07.960
It would probably work, because it's all, it's all APIs that I would expect are emulated fairly faithfully.

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:07.960
Yeah.

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:12.960
I think it's just a BlinkView virtual machine, so I don't think you have to do anything.

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.960
My impression is that it, well, at least the original one was rather more sophisticated.

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:18.960
Like, there was something about like, translating syscalls.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:19.960
I don't know about version two.

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:23.960
But yeah, there's a decent chance it'll work just fine on WSL.

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:32.960
Yeah, I'll put a link to Chris Moffitt's article on creating a, using Windows SL to build a Python development environment on Windows.

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.960
And maybe that'll help people in general.

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:35.960
Maybe this will work.

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:35.960
I don't know.

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:36.960
We can give it a try.

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:37.960
Cool.

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:42.960
And then you also, you know, it's one thing to just say, well, too bad that didn't work.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:44.960
It's a lot better to say.

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.960
And here are some ideas for making it better.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:53.960
So you have a couple of recommendations for data scientists on how to be more efficient with their code and their memory.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:57.960
So I talked earlier about batching, indexing, and compression.

00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:02.960
And I actually gave a, supposed to give a talk at PyCon about that this year.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.960
It was, I mean, there's a recorded recording of it, but I never gave it live.

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:12.960
And there's a series of articles here that sort of talk about those ideas and then show how to apply them in NumPy, show how to apply them in Pandas.

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:23.960
And I started writing some articles about like how to just Python level issues, like how do you, like we talked about with like function calls and just ways to structure a code to reduce memory usage.

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:34.960
So there's a bunch of articles that are already adding more over time, just with sort of the techniques you need to, once you figure out where the problem is to reduce the memory usage.

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:35.960
Right, right.

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:35.960
Yeah.

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.960
I just saw your video.

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.960
I didn't realize, I didn't watch it yet.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:43.960
So I'll put a link to it in the show notes so people can watch your virtual PyCon talk.

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:44.960
Yeah.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:47.960
I've been going to PyCon for a very long time.

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:51.960
And so it's just really sad not being able to see like friends that leave me once a year.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:51:01.960
And I know, PyCon is like my geek holiday, you know, just get out of there and hang out with a lot of my friends that I only see otherwise interact with online.

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:02.960
And it's really special.

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:03.960
It's too bad it didn't happen this year.

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:04.960
Yeah.

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:05.960
Someday.

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:05.960
Yeah.

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.960
Someday it'll be back someday, like everything.

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:09.960
All right.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.960
Well, these are really interesting ideas.

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.960
I think covering them in general was good.

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:15.960
And Phil is a cool project.

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.960
So I think it'll help some people out there who are having challenges.

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:27.960
Maybe their code is using too much memory and swaps out and becomes insanely slow, or they just couldn't process the data they wanted because it didn't work.

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:32.960
So they can hit it with this, use some of your recommendations and maybe unlock some answers.

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:32.960
Yeah.

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.960
I should add, this is a very new project.

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:43.960
And so like, I know one person for whom it worked right, but I also know one person for whom it just wildly misreported the memory usage.

00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:44.960
Okay.

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.960
He's hoping to send me a reproducer later this week.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:47.960
We can fix it.

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:52.960
So if it doesn't work, I very much encourage you to file a bug report.

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:53.960
Let me know.

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.960
I'm happy to do a screen sharing session.

00:51:55.960 --> 00:52:01.960
So some people will bug it just because I want this to be a tool that works for people.

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.960
And so if it's not working, I want to help.

00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:11.960
And it's an early enough stage that I expect that there are still a bunch of major issues, even if it does actually work in some cases.

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:12.960
So please try it.

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:13.960
It might just work.

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.960
And if it doesn't, please let me know.

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:16.960
I'll do my best to help.

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:16.960
Yeah.

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:17.960
Very cool.

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:22.960
And speaking of which, you know, people are asking me recently, hey, I'm looking for an open source project to contribute to.

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:27.960
Do you have any recommendations on ones I might look at or consider contributing to?

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:28.960
What's the story there?

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.960
Are you looking for people who might participate?

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.960
I would be happy to accept contributions.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:37.960
It's some parts of it are, there's a lot of fun stuff in there.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:47.960
Like in terms of low level systems programming, there's like, there's a bunch of rust and like a bunch of C code and like poking into the internals of CPython.

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.960
If that is a thing that interests you, there's a bunch of work there.

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.960
There's also a bunch of UI things that could be done.

00:52:53.960 --> 00:53:04.960
Like, if you think about profiling, the real usage pattern should really be profile this program, try to fix it, and then say, profile this again and show me the difference.

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.960
Like, and then you can have a visualization of the differences.

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:15.960
That is my eventual goal is like, to have a user experience that's not just what you use now, but actually shows you if things are better or worse and where.

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:21.960
So if people are interested in sort of that sort of UX kind of work, there's a room there.

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:25.960
What about building like tutorials and stuff like that?

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:26.960
Yeah.

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:33.960
I mean, like in general, it'd be exciting to see people pick it on, but it's also the same time.

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:34.960
Yeah.

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:35.960
Some low level stuff, right?

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:45.960
You will hit these places where it's like, I'm poking into the, like I'm causing slight memory leaks internally in CPython for optimization purposes.

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:46.960
Yeah.

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:47.960
Things like that.

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:48.960
Sure.

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:56.960
Because you want to be able to refer to pointers being like, there's a bunch of work in order to not have a lot of overhead when you report a new allocation.

00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:04.960
And so you want to be able to like keep like a pointer address in the Python interpreter as a persistent key, which means you have to make sure things don't think garbage.

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:05.960
Yeah.

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:05.960
Makes sense.

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:06.960
Yeah.

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:07.960
I can imagine low level.

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:08.960
This is a beast.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:09.960
Yeah.

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:12.960
The debugging can be tricky, but it's a lot of fun.

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:22.960
And it's a very, I find it sort of a therapeutic project because like, it's like, it's tricky and difficult, but it's also like a very, it's like a closed universe.

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:25.960
You know, you're doing web development or distributed systems.

00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:35.960
It's like, you're talking to remote services and like, you have to spin up five processes and like, you're dependent on the whole external world to make anything work these days.

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:40.960
Otherwise, this is sort of like, it's a program that runs in your computer, read some data, write some data.

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:43.960
Like there's no, there's no outside world.

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:44.960
Yeah, that's cool.

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:51.960
So it's just like, you can stay focused on the problem on hand and not the fact that like GitHub is down or whatever.

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.960
Yeah, I've been there.

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:53.960
All right.

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:55.960
Before I let you out here though, let me ask you the final two questions.

00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:58.960
If you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use?

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:04.960
I use space max, which is a configuration of Emacs that makes Emacs a lot more like a modern ID.

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:05.960
Nice.

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:06.960
Okay.

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:10.960
It makes Emacs like experience jump 20 years forward.

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:11.960
That's awesome.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:12.960
Just by installing and configuring the right packages.

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:13.960
Cool.

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:16.960
And a notable PI PI package.

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:17.960
Pip install.

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:18.960
Is it Phil or Phil dash profile?

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:19.960
I got a pip install.

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:22.960
It's Phil profiler, no dash or hyphen.

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:26.960
So like F I L E R F I L E R.

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:27.960
That's an obvious one.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.960
What's another one that maybe you've come across recently and you're like, oh, this is really cool.

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:31.960
People should know about.

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:36.960
Nothing is, I guess, to mention Austin.

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:42.960
I don't know quite as much about it, but Pyspy is another, another sampling profiler.

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:52.960
And it's another kind of a system programming package where like it's doing these interesting things in Rust where it's like, it looks at like the memory layout.

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:58.960
It doesn't, it looks at the memory layout of your Python program, like parses out the data structures and reads things out.

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:05.960
So it's another sort of very intense system programming, which ideally is all hidden behind the scenes.

00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:06.960
It just gives you really useful results.

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:07.960
Cool.

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:08.960
All right.

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:09.960
That's a good one.

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:10.960
Yeah.

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:11.960
I have to check it out.

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:12.960
I haven't tried that one.

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:13.960
All right.

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:14.960
Final call to action.

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:15.960
People want to get started with Phil.

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:16.960
What do they do?

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:18.960
Go to pythonspeed.com/products/philprofiler.

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:19.960
Maybe get a URL wrong.

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:22.960
I should probably get a shorter URL.

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:23.960
Excuse me.

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:24.960
Google F-I-L space profiler.

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:25.960
That should do it.

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.960
Or you can put a link in the show notes.

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:28.960
Yeah.

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:29.960
I'll definitely have a link in the show notes.

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:30.960
No doubt.

00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:31.960
Yeah.

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:32.960
Google in Phil space profiler works for me.

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:33.960
Works for me.

00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:37.960
Or you can go to pythonspeed.com and then I'll do some links to that and other stuff I've

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:38.960
written.

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:39.960
All right.

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:40.960
Very cool.

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:43.960
Also include the link to your virtual PyCon talk as well so people can check that out.

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:44.960
Cool.

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:45.960
All right.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:46.960
Thanks for having me.

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.960
This has been another episode of Talk Python to Me.

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:51.960

Thanks so much for listening.

00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:48.960
I really appreciate it.

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:50.960
Now get out there and write some Python code.

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:51.960
I'll see you next time.

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:51.960
