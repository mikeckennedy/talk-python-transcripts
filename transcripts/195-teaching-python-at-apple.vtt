00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.020
When you think of learning Python, what type of developer or technologist comes to mind?

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.180
Is it someone looking for their first job or maybe making a move from something like .NET

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.320
over to Python and looking for a shift in their careers? While these are common moves,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.280
you may be surprised how many folks within a tech company learn new languages like Python

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.920
just to stay within that company. On this episode, you'll meet Ron Hayden. He founded

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.560
the Software University internal training program at Apple and is now doing his own

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.160
independent training around Python. I think you'll find his story an interesting element in the mosaic of Python.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.760
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 195, recorded January 9th, 2019.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:56.920
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the ecosystem,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.020
and the personalities. This is your host, Michael Kennedy. Follow me on Twitter where I'm @mkennedy.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.380
Keep up with the show and listen to past episodes at talkpython.fm and follow the show on Twitter via

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.620
at talkpython. Hey, everyone. I want to tell you about a new course we just launched, Introduction to

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.920
Ansible. This one was created by Matthew Mackay of Full Stack Python. If you're involved with deploying a

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.380
web app or managing servers, especially Python web apps, you owe it to yourself to check out Ansible.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.480
It provides a declarative way to provision, configure, and evolve infrastructure and applications. What

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.840
makes it even better is it's written in and can be extended in Python. Check out the course over at

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.360
training.talkpython.fm. Corporate and team options are available too. Ron, welcome to Talk Python.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.500
Thanks. Glad to be here.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.020
It's great to have you here. I'm really looking forward to this peek inside how Apple teaches

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.020
their internal folks Python. I think that's going to be a lot of fun.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.520
This is my very first non-Apple thing in 25 years, so it's also a big new experience for me. And I'm a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.700
big fan of the podcast, so really happy to be here.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.880
Yeah, thanks. And that's really cool. So you've, as we'll get into, you've been at Apple for a really

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.820
long time and now you're just starting off to do a more independent thing. And I think that's a super

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.460
interesting perspective. So definitely dig into that. But before we get to it, what's your story?

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.800
How'd you get into programming in Python?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.860
It started actually pretty much at the beginning. So I've been at Apple about 25 years. And early on,

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.740
when we started creating an engineering team and documentation group, I worked in the technical

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.080
publications. We went to an O'Reilly conference that was for Perl mostly. And I went to a couple of

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.080
Perl things and Perl did not speak to me. And I ended up in the corner with probably the very first

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.920
edition of a bunch of the Python books and wanting to use Python. But the problem was the people I was

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.120
working with on the team all knew Perl. So we created our entire production pipeline in Perl,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.660
which I refused to learn for like two years. I was so annoyed about it.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.640
I'm not doing this.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.980
Exactly. Eventually, I learned a number of things I learned being an engineering manager.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.720
It doesn't work to be an engineering manager if you don't know the technology your team is using.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.940
So I had to break down and learn it. And I got a lot out of it. And I actually kind of liked something.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.640
How good do you think you have to be? Do you have to be able to kind of read and follow?

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.320
Do you have to be able to write basic code? Do you have to be really, really good to understand?

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.320
No, when you do this, actually, that uses too much memory. Use this other technique or this

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.780
other library. What's the level when you say that?

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.620
Also, this is coming from kind of an Apple perspective where the engineering managers are

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.320
very technical and involved. You know, there are other companies where that's not so much the case.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.280
What I found was if I couldn't get down to those details you were talking about, things would go off

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.920
the rails. In fact, what happened for a while was the team was developing our production pipeline and

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.500
things were not working out. And eventually, and this is probably not the greatest engineering manager

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.060
thing to do. But eventually, actually, when they went off to the next O'Reilly conference,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.860
I spent the days they were gone learning Perl and rewriting the production pipeline. Once I realized,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.560
oh my God, this is not in good shape. That was a huge lesson for me as an engineering manager.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.160
From then on, I never let myself get out of touch with the technology of the team. And later on,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:25.560
remember when we were releasing the first iOS SDK and doing a bunch of web stuff related to that. And

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.300
they had a web guy. These were good web guys. It was like, oh, it's not possible to do that. And

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.900
I was like, well, I was working on my personal website yesterday doing this and I did this. So yeah,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.760
I think it's possible.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.360
And here's a small example on how it's going to work, right? Yeah.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.740
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.080
You know, it's so funny. You get into some of these debates of, should we do it this way? Should we do

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.400
things that way? Is that going to work? I don't know. It always seems like there's someone that's

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.440
like, well, that's, you can't do that. That's not going to work. Or it might work in a simple case,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.240
but not really. But the thing that solves that debate better than any other is to just have,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.760
just go, but this does it.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.800
Here it is.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.620
Like that's something beautiful about programming is you can say, no, click the button and it happens.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.000
And then we can discuss that, right?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.840
And a theme for me, and I think we'll probably talk about it a couple of times today,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:17.000
is the biggest jumps in my career and where I made the biggest impact have always been when it was that

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.780
thing. Oh, this is not possible. And I would go home that night or that weekend and I would figure it

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.540
out and I would do it and come back with the solution. And there's nothing more effective,

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.440
like you're saying, than that. And if you just sit there and say, well, I guess they're not going to

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.880
let me do this. Then you kind of put yourself in a box, you know? Yeah.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.300
Getting to the actual Python part. So Zoom, so I always wanted to use Python. I used it a little

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.440
bit personally. That's not what our technology was built on. So Zoom forward, you know, 20 some years

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.580
and I'm running a team called Software University, which we'll probably talk a bit more about.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:57.300
And we had an intern come in who was really into Python. And so he did a presentation. We do a weekly

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.900
engineering presentation that gets put on an internal website and the engineers can look at.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.420
Like a brown bag lunch type thing where it's sort of an internal education thing.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.880
Yeah. Yeah. Except being Apple, it's really high production value and, you know, huge amounts of

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.060
effort are put into each one. And it's something I'm really proud of that program. But so this intern

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:22.400
comes in and does a Python topic and we're like, well, okay, this is, this is Apple. We have Swift,

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.600
we have Objective-C, that's what our interns need. This is going to be really niche, but hey,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.300
we're, you know, we'll let the intern do this. It'll be a good experience for him.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.780
The interest level, just when we announced the talk was off the charts, people were emailing

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.280
saying, when is it happening? Can I show up? When are you going to post the video? And we're like,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.600
what, what's going on here? Why does anyone care about this little scripting language?

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.140
And then it was a sellout crowd. And, you know, we actually had to turn people away.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:53.040
And I'm like, hmm, that's interesting. So I started looking into it and it turned out

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:59.420
that everybody who didn't need to be using Swift or Objective-C was either using Python or wanted to

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:06.700
use Python, either just to do daily workflow tasks or more and more to do data science stuff.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:13.260
So I ended up getting back into Python, developing classes. I spent two, three years just developing

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:19.240
these classes. And one of the great opportunities you get working in a big company like that is I had a

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:25.520
built-in audience. And I could also, I could kind of suck at the beginning because they're getting free

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.780
training. So they get whatever I got. And then I got to do it over and over hundreds and hundreds of

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:36.060
times and eventually got to really know my stuff and to get really, really good responses from the

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:41.900
students. And in fact, by the time I left, I never had less than two to three thousand people signed

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:47.800
up to take the class. It turned out that Python actually was really, really in demand. And that

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.980
kind of changed the whole trajectory of my career. And it's some of the reason that I'm here talking to

00:07:52.980 --> 00:08:00.500
you now was I also, I knew I liked Python, but in the process of developing these classes and doing more

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:06.320
and more work with it, I really fell in love with it. And if it had been some other language, I might've

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.800
taught it, but I wouldn't have gotten to where I was. And I wouldn't have gotten so passionate about it

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.900
that I really wanted to devote myself to it.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:19.280
That's a great story. You know, I had a similar experience in that I started learning Python and

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:26.420
we started working with it in the company I was at around a training perspective. And just the initial

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:33.600
demand was so much higher than what I expected compared to what everyone else was doing. Wow,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.880
there's really something to this. I better personally pay more attention to this because this seems like

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.900
it's been way more important and it's going to have a bigger impact than the perception of a lot

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:47.260
of people around me, you know? Right. Yeah. That sounds like a little similar for you as well.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:52.980
So you said you have been at Apple for 25 years, but this is one of the first things you're doing

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.300
outside of Apple. So what are you doing day to day now? What are you working on?

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:02.360
To my surprise, I ended up getting a book contract because once I had resigned and there was a couple of

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:07.840
months between me resigning and when I was actually leaving, I happened to see a book publisher on

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:13.000
Twitter say, hey, send us proposals, anybody. Right. And I thought, well, what the heck? And I sent them

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.060
a proposal and they accepted it. So I thought I was going to be starting up kind of external training

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:23.520
right now because that's something I passionately want to do. But it turns out for a little while,

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.540
I'm writing a book instead. So that's what I'm just starting to do now. And it's really interesting

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.220
and a little scary. I mean, I've written many books as being a technical writer and I've edited

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:39.740
many books, you know, over the years, but it's a whole different world to be writing the official

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:46.540
documentation for a technology, to have all the technology experts available to you and to know

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:52.760
that people have to read this, right? If we're documenting the API for iOS, well, if you want to use

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:58.040
iOS, you're going to have to read the documentation. Now I have to write a book that people don't have to

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:05.280
read. So I got to make it really compelling and interesting and, you know, come through on all

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.380
that. So it's a really different approach and very interesting challenge.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:16.100
Yeah. Well, congratulations on the book. That's awesome. I've heard writing a book is a lot of work,

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.000
but it's going to be fun too. And you should know, right? It sounds like you've done quite a bit.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.820
Oh yeah. Yeah.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.960
That's cool. So that's going to be a lot of fun. You can't talk about it yet?

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.960
Unfortunately not, but I look forward to being able to in a few months.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.780
That's really great. So right now you're working on the book and you just left Apple,

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.140
I guess maybe to give some folks a little perspective, because a lot of what we're talking

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:42.560
about is the stuff that you did at the time you were at Apple. Maybe just tell folks what you did

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.180
day to day while you were at Apple and then we'll get into the topic.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:50.840
It changed a lot. I had this kind of weird career. I was a manager almost from day one in Silicon Valley.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.100
It was another one of those things I was mentioning where what happened was I started at Oracle

00:10:55.100 --> 00:11:01.940
and two months after I started, the person who hired me left. And I went into the director and said,

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.520
I want to run this team. Now I was like 20 something and I had no experience. I had no right.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:12.540
And he was like, okay, give it a try. And so I became a manager early on. Over time,

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:19.040
I ended up running developer publications at Apple for a while. And that meant as an engineering manager,

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:25.660
first we created the publication workflow. So we needed to take XML and turn it into the websites

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:31.640
and HTML and PDF. And we also needed to parse all the headers and everything and put that all

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.140
together into the documentation. So I was an engineering manager. Then I was running developer

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:40.900
publications, which was really interesting, intense experience at a place like Apple, because

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:45.980
basically everything coming down the pipeline for the next couple of years is aimed at you.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.500
And you have a certain amount of resources and you have to figure out what you're going to cover and

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.640
how you're going to cover it. One of the things I really appreciated about the way Apple works is

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:02.020
you're expected to know your job. So of course, people have opinions and they may have insights,

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:08.740
but for the most part, you are not told what to do. So let's say there are five really important

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:14.980
projects coming up. And you can't put a hundred percent on every one of those projects. You can't

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:20.280
put your best people on every one of those projects. Part of my job was simply to look at what was

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:25.140
coming, look what the impact on developers would be and decide where the resources were going to go

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:29.620
and how we were going to accomplish that. An interesting case, for example, was Swift.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:37.980
Chris Latner, who originally created Swift, came to me two, three years before it launched and said,

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.560
we're working on this language. There are about 25 people who know about it. It was one of the most

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:47.340
secret projects in all of Apple. And he said, we don't know when or if this thing is ever going to

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:53.040
launch, but I would like you to put one of your best people on it now. And that's an interesting

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.000
call, right? Because things, projects like that come up all the time. So I mean, oh, I have a new

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.300
idea for a language or whatever. They don't go anywhere or they kind of half go somewhere and

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:06.800
then they drop or whatever. So to decide to put serious resources into something that might never

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.040
happen, but if it did happen would be really significant. It was an interesting call. And

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.700
fortunately, I had a good relationship with Chris and I trusted him. And so I did it. And we hired some

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:21.420
great people and put them on the project. That's the kind of thing I was doing from day to day.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:26.880
Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. So let me ask you a little bit about Swift. I think there's a lot

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.380
of interesting parallels in that language with Python. You know, the playgrounds feel very much

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:39.020
like a REPL or Jupyter in some sense. The language has a lot of syntactical similarities. The thing I

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:44.760
want to ask you is why do you think it was successful? It's not very common that there's some big company

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.680
like Apple that's standardized on a language and says, you know, we're just going to completely

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:55.580
switch our most important stuff to this new API. And I felt like it was an immediate and complete

00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:01.860
switch when Swift came along. That kind of surprised me, but I think it's a positive one more or less.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:02.900
Why do you think that was?

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.600
Well, I'll also say, at least for me, and I think for us in general, the immediate adoption and the

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:14.740
language was a surprise to us. You can think, oh, a company like Apple, you know, we're going to say

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:18.020
do X and everyone's going to do X. No, we could have put out Swift and everyone could have said,

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:22.240
we're not going to use it. So we didn't know what would happen. We didn't know if playgrounds would be

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:28.240
good. We didn't know. We just had to put it out. And we also knew that it wasn't ready. But one of the

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.920
great things about Chris was he knew that they had to put out the language before it could be technically

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:40.400
completed. Because there was no way on earth we could come out with a 1.0 of Swift without that process of

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:48.400
developers using it and providing feedback. In terms of why it was successful, I think that a simple answer is

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:55.240
it simply works or it looks much more like programming languages that people are used to. And Objective-C

00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:00.820
always had that oddness. I mean, back from when I worked at Next before Apple, and so we would go around trying to get

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:07.760
people to use Objective-C. And it was the number one barrier to getting Next Step into businesses,

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.880
because the engineers would look at these square brackets and they'd be like, what is this? We can't

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:19.000
possibly teach our engineers this. And it was a huge problem. So I think that when people saw a language

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.240
that looked like languages they were familiar with, that was a big, big win. And then the fact that it

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:30.720
incorporated a lot of really modern concepts. Interestingly, Swift actually made Objective-C

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:37.600
better because a lot of the improvements they made to Objective-C were actually in preparation for switching to Swift.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:47.040
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Cloudbolt.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:52.900
Friends don't let friends violate PEP 8, nor do they let them spend their days in an unfulfilling work environment.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:58.380
Good news. Your friends at Cloudbolt want your help developing their state-of-the-art cloud management software.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:04.320
Built with Django and ranked as the number one product of its kind, Cloudbolt's looking for talented engineers of all kinds.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:09.420
Located in beautiful Portland, Oregon, Cloudbolt is an hour from the Pacific Ocean and Mount Hood.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.420
You're not in Portland? Not a problem.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:17.420
Cloudbolt offers a relocation stipend to the Pacific Northwest and is also hiring solution engineers everywhere.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:23.160
Whether you're interested in containers, hypervisors, or just writing clean performant Python code,

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.900
Cloudbolt would love to hear from you.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.400
Visit talkpython.fm/cloudbolt for more information.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.540
So you were at Apple for a long time.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:37.400
It sounds like if you wanted to work there, definitely knowing Swift and Objective-C might be worthwhile.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:43.460
But also, it sounds like there's just quite a rich community of Python programmers there.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:51.080
What advice would you have for people listening to this show who are really mostly passionate about Python if they want to work there?

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.040
I've run into this, too.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:57.980
I went to my first PyCon this year, and I was talking to someone, and they're like, oh, I had no idea Apple used Python.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.160
I might have applied for a job there if I'd known that.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:08.240
I think that it is absolutely a big part of things, especially if you're doing any machine learning or data science, you will be using Python going in.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:19.800
Unfortunately, the big caveat, I have to say, is because macOS ships Python 2.7, that's what's used internally and almost everywhere.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.260
Not everywhere, but almost everywhere.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.420
And that's going to be a challenge, right?

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:29.460
Especially as we hit 2020, especially as pandas and things are dropping support.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.300
Yeah, pandas just announced that they're dropping support soon.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.480
Right, right.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.120
I mean, these things are happening, right?

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:41.000
I think in the data science fields, then, you have a good chance of being able to go to 3.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.580
And if I were continuing there, I would have really been pushing that.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.660
There are a lot of QA people using Python.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.720
There's a lot of internal QA Python libraries.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:55.440
And unfortunately, in that case, I don't see it changing anytime soon.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.680
And I think part of my discussion today is that I know we're all excited to get to 3.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.480
I'm excited to be using 3 now.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.960
The shackles are off.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.940
Do whatever you want.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.220
And I've been listening to a lot of your recent episodes where people are like, okay, finally, we're there.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:23.520
I have to say, we still can't forget about the fact that there are going to be thousands and thousands of developers in these large organizations with huge amounts of built up technologies that aren't going to switch anytime soon.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.200
And I think that's interesting.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:45.400
When you have, let's say, when you have a QA library that is highly specific to what your team does and that has been built up over five plus years and has a huge amount of code in it, we can all say, okay, they're dropping support for Python 2, so you've got to move to 3.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.540
Where are you going to go?

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.920
And I think that's a huge amount of time to do that.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:01.440
I think what I would encourage in any organization at this point is don't let yourself get in that trap.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:06.040
If you're going to go to 3.5 million.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.420
And if you're dealing with a technology like this, you've got to take responsibility.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.760
It's like those projects I was talking about before.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.200
Like, go home and start it in 3 and say, here it is.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.780
And start, you know, whatever you can do to move it forward.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.540
Don't just accept it.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:26.080
Because what I fear in some of these cases is you're going to be another five years down the road.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.760
And then you're really not going to have a choice at some point.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.880
You're going to have to switch.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.840
And you're going to be kind of up a crick.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.800
Yeah, you definitely are.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.720
You know, I feel like the two big sticks in this debate.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.700
There's lots of carrots.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.320
But the two sticks.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.320
One is security.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.540
And sometimes it doesn't matter, right?

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.560
Like an internal QA testing library probably is not exposed on the internet.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.440
It probably is not a security risk, really.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:56.260
But then there's also the new shiny things that you don't get.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:00.540
Right now, the machine learning libraries are Keras, TensorFlow, and so on.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:08.640
But, you know, wait until either they drop two and come along with some really great feature that you almost have to have.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.340
Or there's something better that's Python 3 only, right?

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:17.600
At some point, there's going to be like, why can't we keep up with this company?

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.920
Well, they have all the good tools.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.660
And we're stuck on these tools that are last generation.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.660
But that's not a this week, next week, one year.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.380
That's a by the time you realize it, right?

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.960
That technical debt is bad.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.420
Yeah.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.040
It's deep, deep, and it takes a long time to get out of it.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.100
Here's a funny thing.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:39.460
In the teaching I would do, I would talk about here's how it works in three.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.540
Here's what we don't get if you don't move to three, et cetera.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:49.080
I actually think one of the features most likely to get people personally motivated is F-strings.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:49.440
Yeah.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.200
They love them.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:50.820
They're great.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:21:01.500
I actually have a theory that if that feature had been rolled out early on in three and not put into two, they would have had more conversion because it's just one of those things where you're like, I want that.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.300
And then that gets you to start making changes, you know?

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:04.540
Yeah.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.060
It's definitely really much more concise and it's faster, right?

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:08.240
Yeah.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.300
So there's like, it's good just all across the board.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.360
You say faster.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.560
I wonder, you know, in some cases, probably faster is going to be a thing as well, right?

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.460
Like Python 3 is starting to be faster in general, right?

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:24.880
So if you can run a quarter fewer servers, you know, 50 instead of 80 servers, I don't know, maybe that starts to add up.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.740
But that's a rare, it's a big company problem, not most people's problems.

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.340
Most people aren't, you know, scaled that far out.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:35.680
In my experience, the scale issues would be mostly in the data space.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.700
And so they've already got lots of reasons, right?

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.020
It's just one more big reason for them to do it.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:40.880
Yeah, for sure.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.540
Okay.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.480
So let's talk a little bit about this software university thing.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.680
You talked a bit about it.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.760
How did you end up founding that, the team there?

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.380
Tell us what it is and then how you got started on it.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:50.580
Yeah.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.320
Well, it's the thing I'm most proud of in my career at Apple.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.420
And I first have to say, it's not Apple University.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.920
There's a thing called Apple University.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:04.320
And people always confuse them, which is my fault because I worked with Apple University.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.540
I was big fans of the people there.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.660
They teach sort of culture and how to be successful at Apple.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:14.460
And so when I was coming up with the team, I wanted a way to kind of associate ourselves

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.300
with them and kind of make it clear what kind of thing we were.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.960
Unfortunately, then everybody just thought we were Apple University.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.400
But Software University was focused on teaching software skills.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.320
We do onboarding and teach software skills across the company.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.640
And it started out with that weekly program I talked about.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.960
The head of software engineering had asked me to put together this program.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.620
And we ran it for like 10 years.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:42.820
Literally, me and a colleague, a couple of colleagues in our lunchtimes would do all the work necessary

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.880
in addition to our regular job to have this weekly presentation.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.760
It was very popular.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:52.940
And eventually, you know, after literally 10 years, we I think there was a big performance move.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:58.620
There was a release where they had to the mandate was to improve performance across the board,

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.800
like 20 percent or 30 percent or something like that.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.100
And we said, well, you know what?

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.200
We have this mechanism.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.460
We have this way that we're able to broadcast stuff that everybody likes and uses.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.620
We can help you with this.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:16.860
We can do a special program to educate people about what they need to do to improve performance

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:17.740
across the board.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:24.540
And so we did a whole bunch of focus topics on that and had real experts across the company

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.460
doing it.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:28.460
And we put out white papers, which each one of their talks to help out.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:34.720
And that was so impactful that I was then able to say, well, you know, we could keep doing

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.260
this kind of stuff if you gave us some headcount.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.560
And that became Software University.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:46.340
So a very small team, huge impact across the organization, you know, teaching because one of

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:51.300
the funny things for a few years after Swift came out and still true in large part is the

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.720
outside world was using Swift.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:59.540
We were not because we had such a massive, massive code base in Objective-C that, you know, it was

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.760
going to take a long time to begin that transition.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:07.280
So we're actually in a situation where before each worldwide developers conference, we would

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:12.160
run special boot camps to teach the people who are going to be at the conference.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.720
Here's what's going on in Swift.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.700
Here's what you need to know.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:15.760
Here's the new features.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.520
Because they wouldn't personally have been using it.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.640
So that really blows my mind.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.760
I've seen that before.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.760
But it, you know, you think about it, it makes sense.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.980
But just from the outside, it doesn't really.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:26.600
Right.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:32.220
Like I've seen that other big tech companies that, you know, have similar technology stacks

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:32.580
and whatnot.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:38.900
And what's really surprising is they'll bring in external training companies to teach their

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:44.540
own programming language to their people or their own developer APIs to their people.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:50.160
And it's like, how can this possibly be that you work at company X and, you know, someone's

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.320
coming in to teach you about the premier technology.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.340
It's a big group of people, right?

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:58.440
And they all come with different skill sets and they don't all work on the same thing.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.880
But it's, it sounds like a similar story here.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.020
And you also have to realize they're not necessarily all bought in, right?

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:07.440
Like, so something like Swift comes along, a small group of people did it.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:07.880
Yeah.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.880
They had, it's a very opinionated language and different people have different opinions.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.320
And since they have the option of using another language, they may be like, eh, I don't

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:16.680
like it.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.780
Our team isn't going to use it.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.880
And then you have a whole kind of, you know, education and process.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.920
Or even if you like it, you might think it won't succeed.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.160
So you're not going to mess up your product and your, your thing by choosing this other

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.680
library or language.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.640
All right.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.840
So maybe we talk a little bit about your experience teaching Python at Apple.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.220
So you had, sounds like you've done a lot of classes there internally.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.540
Yeah.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.380
Yeah.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.820
So what was that experience like?

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:49.640
Well, when I started out, I would teach one set of content two ways.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.640
So one was for new programmers and one was for experienced programmers.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.280
It was the same content, but for new programmers, I would go about half the speed.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:02.060
And over the years, what I learned was that was the entirely wrong approach.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:06.880
The need of experienced programmers versus new programmers and new programmers, at least

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.180
my students, these were people who were probably not trying to get a job programming.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.880
They had stuff in their, in their job that they wanted to solve with programming.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:21.820
Although for QA people, many QA people came in and did manual, what we call black box testing,

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:22.900
especially on iOS.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.020
Almost with a script and a checklist, right?

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:25.800
Yeah, exactly.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.540
And for a long time, that was okay because, you know, there weren't that many features,

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:34.600
but now that it's cloud and this and that and five zillion apps and, you know, your whole

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.340
life is on it.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.280
And there are many different models of the phone.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.500
We could no longer just do manual testing.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:44.200
So people who had never intended to be programmers were suddenly now being required to be a programmer

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.200
as part of their job.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.380
They were also my students.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:53.120
What I found was the goal for new programmers versus experience is very different.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.580
I originally thought my job was to give them a survey of like, this is what, here's a

00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:58.900
little bit of everything in programming.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.840
So you have an idea of what programming is about.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:06.560
And by the end, I dropped probably 75% of my content.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:12.760
And I decided, no, the goal is by the time you leave this class, that you're comfortable

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:20.120
with the idea of sitting down, starting a Python file and trying to solve a problem, any problem.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.840
So that's what I just tried to get to.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:27.440
And so I put a lot more repetition in because I also realized having been programming for

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.900
so long and writing about it for so long, I would think, okay, we talked about for loops.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.160
Now we move on to the next topic.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:39.240
Well, no, you know, they needed it three, four or five times to understand what a for loop

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:39.520
was.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.140
Because there's different levels to that, right?

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:46.640
Like if you're a professional programmer, you just need to learn Python.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:53.720
So you programmed in C# or Java or whatever, and you've for looped it to death, right?

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.280
You know, the concept of the for loop perfectly.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.420
It's just like, okay, well, how does the syntax work?

00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.380
And what are the gotchas?

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.560
You're good, right?

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.620
Like you can get that really quick.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.500
But if you're like, well, I got to do this a lot.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.880
And I don't want to just write it over and over.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.320
Like the whole idea even of a loop, that's a different thing.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.640
And that's where the repetition, I think, is super, super important.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.120
Because maybe you take one slice of that onion each time through, and eventually you get the

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:19.920
whole concept.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:20.740
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.180
So that is where I ended up.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:26.780
The other thing I started doing right toward the end that was really successful, to my surprise,

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.700
is different classes go at very different speeds.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.400
So I would have people who just couldn't even get through all the material because the people

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.800
in the class needed a lot of time.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.860
And I would have another class, still a new programmer, that would just zoom through the

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:38.220
material.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:41.300
And I'd be kind of like, well, okay, we're done for the day.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:41.680
Go home.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.660
And people are like, well, what?

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.600
We've got another hour or two left in the class.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.640
And so what I started doing was saying, okay, we're going to do bonus topics.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.120
Does anyone have a question?

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.580
Or I would even start to teach one of the experience topics or something.

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:59.780
Because someone would ask about regular expressions, which I had stopped teaching to new programmers.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.960
And I'd say, okay, let's talk about regular expressions.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.760
And that turned out to be really valuable.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:10.860
People really appreciated that because they were, first of all, they seemed to really enjoy

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:14.100
the fact they could ask any question and I could answer it because I'd been spending so

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.960
long doing this stuff and I'd developed so much content.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.080
And it let them see things that they wouldn't normally see.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.020
So that was interesting.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:26.420
It's that combination then of repetition and not teaching too much, but also being willing

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:31.340
to satisfy their curiosity and spend a good deal of time just talking about whatever the

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.340
students wanted to talk about.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.740
Yeah, I think that's a good point.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:40.440
Basically, any presentation and teaching training is like a really long presentation, right?

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:46.140
Leaving some room for a little bit of slack for exploration, right?

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:51.040
Like, I'm going to show them all this stuff, but let's leave five minutes here in like a

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:55.680
conference speech or let's leave an hour at the end of this week so that when they say,

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.080
that's great, but I want to put that on the web.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.660
How does that work?

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:03.340
Or, you know, I actually need to work with CSV files.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.300
How does, is that possible, right?

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.540
Like, well, actually import, you know, dictatorator, right?

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:10.860
So things like that.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.880
I think that's a huge value.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.460
It often gets lost because you're like, well, we've got to cover all these things.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:15.700
Yep.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:16.080
Yep.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.900
And then for experienced programmers, the goal I developed was, of course, a lot of times

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.760
they are just coming in wanting to know how does a for loop work in this and how to,

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:29.520
and my goal was to kind of trick them into saying, okay, I'm going to teach you Python.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.760
But what I really focused on was teaching them to be Pythonic and really getting across like,

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:39.760
don't do that thing where you learn a little bit of the language over the weekend and then

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.640
you never really know how it works.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.860
And I can't tell you how many times people who had been using Python for a while would

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:50.000
take the class and they'd say, oh my God, I never actually understood what a comprehension

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:50.720
was before.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.860
I was just copying and pasting these things.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.080
I didn't really know what they did.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.480
Now I understand what they do.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.700
And that, so that was my goal was to get them to actually understand it.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:05.640
And also to use things like comprehensions, which as I'm sure you've experienced non people

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.340
who've not immersed themselves in Python don't end up using something like that because it's

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.640
not, it doesn't exist in where they came from.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.100
Right.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.060
If you don't, you don't change your mindset.

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:14.360
Yeah.

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:18.700
You don't even know this is now a tool in your toolbox or when it applies, right?

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:19.660
Same with generators.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.520
I have to believe that generators are out there in other languages,

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.580
but I never ran into that myself.

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:29.880
And so I would have to spend a lot of time explaining not only what they were and how

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.600
they worked, but like why you would want to use these.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.420
And of course, if you're dealing with large amounts of data, that can be a really critical

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.420
feature.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.840
I think generators and generate expressions and all that are, they're just like magic and

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.780
people haven't taken the time to get to know them.

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:49.200
Like you say, if they're doing anything with lots of data that coming off of the network,

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.960
it's coming off of disk, like it, it can just make all the difference.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.760
Yeah.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.540
There's some other languages.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:57.120
I think maybe even JavaScript is getting it.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:01.420
I haven't been tracking the new JavaScript that much, but I heard something about, about

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.420
that.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:06.120
But anyway, it's, it's out there some other places, but I, it definitely is really well

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.420
embraced in the Python language.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:07.640
Right.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.420
I think that's great.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.100
Yeah.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:16.080
There was a recent article blog post, whatever you call it by somebody who said, I can't remember

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:16.640
what the name of it was.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.460
Something to the effect of like eight reasons.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.600
I hate Python and I'm just going to say it.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.860
I hate Python, something like this.

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:28.560
And it was, it was basically the prototypical example of the person that you described not

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.580
going through the process.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:29.920
Right.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.320
Right.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:37.240
They had to work in Python and they really just liked C and some other languages that

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:42.120
were basically C languages and they just learned enough to make it work.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:42.480
Right.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.980
They're like, okay, well I have to type this to get the library.

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:48.440
I have to type this to, but they didn't actually bother to, to learn.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.760
Learn very much about any of those features.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.840
So they're like, this thing completely sucks.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.960
The way that you import stuff is horrible.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.140
I don't know where stuff comes from.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:59.380
It's like, well, there's a different way you can do it.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:03.440
You don't have to do imports, you know, from this import star, there's other options.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:03.660
Right.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:08.600
But it was, it was basically, this person was really frustrated with Python because they

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.440
had said, well, look, Python is easy.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.320
I'm going to learn it in the weekend.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.780
I'm going to learn it really quickly.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.020
But soon as I get it to work, I'm going to stop investigating.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.340
As soon as I get something that works.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:22.660
And I think that's actually a little bit of, a little bit of the language is curse of

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:24.060
its success, right?

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:29.780
Like you can get a cursory understanding of it quickly, but then if you don't keep going,

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.400
you actually miss why people like it.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:31.660
Right.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:37.180
And I would say for myself, the feature that I really just started using more and more,

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:40.460
and the more I understood it, the more problems it solved is the exception handling.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:46.720
I wish there was a different phrase than even exception handling, because that implies, oh,

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.920
this is just what you do to deal with errors.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:54.060
When the more you absorb the full set of features around exception handling, the more you start

00:33:54.060 --> 00:34:00.020
to realize, no, I can really solve code problems and structure my code around this in ways that

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.660
other languages just don't allow for, right?

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:09.540
The fact that you can basically return any kind of value in an exception allows you to

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:14.380
do just really great things that if you just think of it as, oh, this is what I have to

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:16.140
do when there's some error that might show up.

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:17.660
You'll never do those things.

00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:18.380
Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:24.020
And the more subtle stuff like with statements and context managers for sort of durability

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.260
and all those kinds of things.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:25.780
Absolutely.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:31.900
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Rollbar.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.300
Got a question for you.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.020
Have you been outsourcing your bug discovery to your users?

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:38.660
Have you been making them send you bug reports?

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.360
You know there's two problems with that.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.340
You can't discover all the bugs this way.

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.900
And some users don't bother reporting bugs at all.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.800
They just leave, sometimes forever.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.600
The best software teams practice proactive error monitoring.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.560
They detect all the errors in their production apps and services in real time and debug important

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.000
errors in minutes or hours, sometimes before users even notice.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.080
Teams from companies like Twilio, Instacart, and CircleCI use Rollbar to do this.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:09.620
With Rollbar, you get a real-time feed of all the errors so you know exactly what's broken

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:10.160
in production.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:15.940
And Rollbar automatically collects all the relevant data and metadata you need to debug the errors

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.340
so you don't have to sift through logs.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.340
If you aren't using Rollbar yet, they have a special offer for you.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.320

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.280
When you're teaching the class, you said you use Jupyter.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.540
I want to tell people a little bit about how that works.

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:56.040
Yeah, I actually, this came out of going to the PyCon.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:02.080
I knew about Jupyter, IPython, et cetera, but I'd never really got around to playing with

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:02.260
it.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.900
And then when I saw, I took some tutorials there.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.940
And when I saw how it was being used, I was like, oh my God, I have to use this in class.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:14.340
And I literally went that evening from the conference and rewrote all my material in Jupyter.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.080
And now I've become obsessed.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.960
I basically, I write my website in Jupyter.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.020
I do my coding in Jupyter.

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:28.180
And I've written my own conversion scripts to produce things in HTML and that sort of thing.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:31.920
And I've just found it to be this amazing environment.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.920
And I'm also a big fan of Markdown.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:40.380
And I think that Jupyter is a great way to get more use out of Markdown because what

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.500
people would typically do, and this is where you end up with restructured text and all that,

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.220
right, is they just keep adding features.

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:48.440
And the brilliance of Markdown is simplicity.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:52.360
And if you start adding more and more tags to it, you lose the benefit.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:56.420
Jupyter, because each cell, you can put tags in there and do other things.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.980
You can put a structure on top of the Markdown.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:03.800
So for example, what I'll do is I will add a tag to a cell that says center.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.280
And then when I output the HTML, I center that content.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.320
Well, I didn't have to add to Markdown some kind of center tag.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.500
And so Markdown does what it does.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.020
Jupyter does what it does.

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:18.180
And I just find the combination to be really brilliant.

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:23.540
And I think one of the reasons I'm so passionate about it is because I spent my career dealing

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:29.620
with documentation formats and creating formats, you know, creating templates in XML and such.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:37.360
So what I saw how hard it is to do a simple format is almost impossible to design a simple

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.980
documentation format because the minute you have customers start using it, they start saying,

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:44.380
oh, well, I want you to add this and I want you to add that.

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.940
And I spent a lot of my career saying no to writers.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.900
We're not going to give you that because we give you that.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.800
It's going to cause this problem and this problem later down the track.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:57.260
So when you look at that combination or you like you look inside a Jupyter file and see

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:02.740
that it's just a JSON file, a very simple JSON format that is extremely easy to parse, you

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:07.800
realize this could only happen by one or two people doing this thing and then not letting

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:13.200
themselves get sucked into adding all these features that would then turn it into a mess.

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:13.620
Right.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:15.640
They didn't try to write Word for Python.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:16.360
Yeah, exactly.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.960
They just tried to create this nice little notebook format.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.120
That's cool.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.080
I think, I do think there's a lot of value for using Jupyter notebooks.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:30.180
It must be nice to have as like class handouts, like here's the notebook that we went through

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:34.040
because it lets, you know, it's great to have like a PDF of the slides, right?

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:34.940
Okay, super.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.180
I can type that back in or get it somewhere.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:40.480
But, you know, the Jupyter version, you get to explore.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:40.960
Right.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:45.660
It solves many class problems for me because I used to, I have the students using Sublime

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.320
Text usually.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:51.980
I like Sublime Text for teaching because in addition to having good syntax coloring and general good

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:57.260
Python support, it shows the results of the script in line, which is most other things

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:01.100
you use, you know, it either a DB editor or something's going to pop up a different window

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.780
or people have to look somewhere else for the results.

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.940
So Sublime Text is really good for students.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:10.240
And I was teaching with Sublime Text live, but then someone would ask a question and I'd had

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.220
to comment out some of the code and put in some new code.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:17.180
And then especially for new programmers, they would have no idea what was going on because

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:18.520
I'm changing around everything.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:24.200
When I moved to Jupyter and someone asked a question and I can just enter a new cell and

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.360
put the code in and run it, it solves so many problems.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.980
So it's really elegant for teaching.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:31.560
Yeah, it definitely seems like it.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:38.440
I mentioned earlier that I felt that the Playgrounds was something like Jupyter, the Swift Playgrounds.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:44.740
Do you think if Jupyter had been something that, say, Chris Lattner and folks had been playing

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:48.960
with already and maybe had a little more traction, do you think Swift Playgrounds would not exist?

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.620
And there'd just be a Jupyter version that ran Swift?

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.060
It's a good question.

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:56.880
And I know that I've seen there's at least a couple of projects out there of people working

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.520
to get Swift integrated into Jupyter.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:04.120
I know, I mean, Chris and company were experts on all sorts of languages.

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:08.540
And I know that there were various influences on Playgrounds.

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:13.480
I guess the way I'll answer your question is I would say if I had known about Jupyter at

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:19.620
the time when our department got to be somewhat involved in the process of designing Playgrounds

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.920
because it was in part a documentation feature.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.320
And so we worked with them on all that.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:31.700
I think if I had been aware of it, I certainly would have pushed for more of that because I

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:33.260
feel that that simplicity would be served.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.700
However, it may not have been the right thing for Apple.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:41.060
An important thing about something like Playgrounds is that the fact that you can run these really

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:45.780
cool little games and other things and show visually what's going on there, that's a really

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:49.840
helpful thing to promoting the language and promoting the learning aspect of it.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.560
So, you know, you have other concerns that you have to think about.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.380
Yeah, of course.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:41:00.260
So you've had a lot of experience at these large tech companies working with Python.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:05.600
And we talked a little bit about the two and three divide and some of that technical debt.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:12.880
You had a story about converting from one language to another back in the publishing days.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.860
Tell us a bit about that.

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:22.240
Well, so we had this whole publication workflow and we decided to do the next big jump, right?

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:28.240
And we wanted to get out of Perl and we wanted to fix all the problems, you know, that you

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.780
have when you have a big thing that's been running for a long time.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:34.640
You just think if we could just write this from scratch, it would be all the problems would

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:34.940
be gone.

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:35.580
It'd be perfect.

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:39.680
I made every mistake and I've learned now that this is a pattern, right?

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:44.020
And it's a pattern that I warn people about, which is, okay, well, yeah, we're just going

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:44.820
to write the new thing.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:51.620
And then what we will do is because in the meantime, we have to keep things publishing every day,

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.960
we'll write a bridge script.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:59.180
So it will bridge from the previous stuff, you know, the previous version of the content,

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.240
source content to the new version.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:06.080
And then at some point, we'll just cut off the bridge and we'll go forward with the new

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:06.360
stuff.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.600
That's not how it works.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:16.980
And what happens is when you have an enterprise level production workflow that's been around

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:23.880
for a long time, there are hundreds or thousands of edge cases in business cases that have been

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:28.640
built in or bolted on or whatever to fix all sorts of problems.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:33.900
When you write the new thing from scratch, you're rediscovering all of those.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:39.760
So what happens is you start saying, well, we'll have the bridge script fix those things.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:44.000
Well, the bridge script is supposed to go away, but it starts becoming the biggest part of the

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.380
project and it starts taking up all of your time.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:49.920
And now you're doing duplicate work often because some new feature will come along and you have to

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.160
put it in your old production workflow because you're still using that.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.180
And you have to put it in your new one or you have to do something.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:59.040
And so the end of the day, we had this great new version of our workflow.

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.120
The HTML output was wonderful.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.220
It was a huge improvement.

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:07.460
And I had to kill the project because every time you clicked around, every third or fourth

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:15.300
link would crash this thing because it couldn't deal with all of those edge cases and everything.

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:19.280
And so at the end of the day, what I learned, and I think a lot of people have learned this,

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:23.860
is if you have a large enterprise level workflow, accept it.

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:24.560
You have it.

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:29.680
Your only option is to gradually convert it piece by piece.

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:36.820
Find ways to isolate certain pieces of functionality and then upgrade that portion of it and do it

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:37.360
piece by piece.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.760
But don't think that you're going to be able to run two different workflows and then switch

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:41.640
from one to the other.

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.380
Maybe someone out there has made it work, but I think it's a recipe for disaster.

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.320
And it's one of the biggest mistakes I ever made.

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.440
That sounds really not so good.

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:56.380
So you had the Perl one before and you tried to switch it over to Python through this bridge

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:56.820
thing, right?

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:58.000
No, we weren't doing Python.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.340
I even forget what it was we were switching it to at the time.

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:03.900
This was before Python was a factor.

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:03.980
Sure.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:07.860
So, but if that one got canceled, did you just go back to the Perl one or is there now

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:08.420
something new?

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:12.360
Well, I haven't been doing that for a long time and I know, I think they finally did do

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.540
a whole new production workflow.

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:18.500
But yeah, we were stuck with the Perl for another five plus years.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:23.120
And it wouldn't surprise me if there's still a bunch of it in there because, you know, it's

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.460
really hard to get rid of all that.

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:25.820
Then you get into the situation.

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:31.920
I think this is where we're headed with Python 2 as well, where you start having to ask engineers

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:37.100
to join your team or join your company to do something like Perl, right?

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:41.680
And you get fewer and fewer people who know how to do it and you get fewer and fewer people

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.760
who want to do it.

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.280
I'm always going to do this classic joke.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:48.040
If you've heard this of the guy who's a COBOL programmer and he was so sick of everybody hiring

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:53.220
him for COBOL because there weren't COBOL programmers around that he had himself frozen so that in

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:54.980
the future he could have a different career.

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:59.940
And when he's unfrozen and wakes up, you know, Bill Gates is standing over him and he's like,

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:00.940
oh, Bill, great.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:01.760
What can I do for you?

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.400
And Bill's like, you're the guy who knows COBOL, right?

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:04.340
Exactly.

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:06.400
Yeah, I can totally see that.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:14.460
And there are so many projects that are stuck in these old languages, you know, BB6 even.

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:17.380
There's so much in the enterprise space that people put together.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:18.160
Really complicated.

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.900
And there's better paths forward.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:24.360
But I think it is all these little tiny details, right?

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:28.200
You know, it's one thing to say, well, it has to do X, Y, and Z.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:33.120
It's like, well, but there's like a hundred little bizarre tweaks that we catch it under this

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:36.320
circumstance or we do that differently if it's from that department or whatever, right?

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:36.740
It's crazy.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:37.460
Yeah.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:42.900
Well, I definitely think there's going to be some good consulting opportunities for people

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.160
that know how to take Python 2 code to Python 3 code.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:53.940
I don't know when the peak of that opportunity will be, but, you know, maybe spring 2020 or

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:58.080
after the first really bad security problem found, it's Python 2 that's not going to be fixed.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:03.140
But like this COBOL programmer type person, having those skills and knowing how to do that

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.700
switch actually might be really valuable.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:09.820
In the meantime, what people can do, and I started pushing this really heavily in my experience

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:13.380
classes, is start using Python 2 like 3.

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:17.640
You know, use the features that were backported, especially for dictionaries and such.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:23.460
As near as I could tell, I could rarely find a tutorial or a book that talked about the features

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:28.360
that had been added, say, to dictionaries after the fact that turned them into the same

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.580
thing that they do in 3, right?

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:33.900
So it's where you're getting those different objects.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:38.200
Instead of getting a list, instead of everything being a list, you're getting the objects back

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.480
that don't take up memory and such.

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:43.480
Like X range and that kind of stuff, right?

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.200
Yeah.

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.920
And in the dictionaries they have, what they have is for each thing, if you ask for values

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:52.640
or keys, there's another method, which at the moment now I'm spacing on it, which will,

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.000
instead of giving you a list, will give you what you would get in Python 3.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.880
And so that's an easy way, because I think that's some of the code that is most problematic,

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:05.860
right, are things that are relying on you getting a list back, and it's no longer a list in Python 3.

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:10.460
So some of the easiest ways to future-proof your code is just to use those things when they're

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:10.860
available.

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:11.640
Yeah, for sure.

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:17.100
So on these big projects, do you think you can test your way through that?

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:23.000
Like, if you could imagine every single case that is like one of these weird edge cases,

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.900
and you just wrap up the app and you feed it the inputs and you check the output, possible?

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:29.520
Reasonable?

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:34.140
I think it's great if a team has been disciplined enough to do that.

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:38.140
And there are times when I, like anybody, well, I really like unit testing.

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:40.000
I literally like test-driven development.

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.220
I fall in and out of it, as I think most engineers do.

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:47.560
But when I was really good, especially on projects like when I created, say, a CSS parser,

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:54.420
and so for every single feature that I would put in tests, then my parser wasn't very fast,

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.840
so my team got annoyed about that.

00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.180
And one of them did to me what I did to people, which is went home and wrote a faster version.

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:07.180
But because I had put a test in for every single feature, we were able to just swap in the new code with no problem.

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:07.520
Right.

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.220
Run it.

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:08.840
Does it pass?

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:09.120
Good.

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:09.440
Yeah.

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:14.580
But I would argue it's, I think it's getting more common as people have gotten better about this,

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:18.760
and testing functionality has gotten integrated into the languages and frameworks.

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:22.280
It's relatively rare that people have done that amount of testing.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:22.620
Yeah.

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:24.820
That's probably true.

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:26.300
All right.

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:27.860
Well, it's definitely an interesting problem.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.840
And I know a lot of people have it both trying to cross languages,

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.480
and we're going to have it with this 2 to 3 thing that's coming.

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.100
I do think it's less bad with 2 to 3.

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:40.900
It's not like you're starting completely from scratch.

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:45.860
I mean, you may decide to start from scratch with Python 3 and rewrite the thing,

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:48.740
because that's both tempting and sometimes the right way to go.

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:53.700
But at least it's more of an upgrade, like it's a really big upgrade to your project,

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:59.440
rather than you can't add Python to Perl progressively to it, right?

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:03.940
I think there's the same risk, which is if you don't spend some time truly learning

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:09.200
what's different about 3 and the philosophical changes to deal with memory usage

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.500
and such more generators everywhere, that kind of stuff.

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:16.920
If you start converting your code without philosophically understanding the differences,

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.800
then you're not going to get the benefits from 3.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.140
And you may not even realize some of the stuff that you need to change.

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:23.120
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.520
It's very similar there.

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.380
All right.

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:28.740
Well, you've done all this cool stuff at Apple, and you've been there for a long time,

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:31.500
and you hear a lot of good things about the company,

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:35.140
but leaving and breaking on your own, that's a pretty big step.

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:38.020
I know from personal experience, it's a big deal.

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:40.900
What was the decision making there?

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:41.080
Yeah.

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.100
Well, it was great working at Apple.

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:47.520
I had a great career there, and people were very supportive of me

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:49.720
and let me do all these wonderful different things.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:56.020
And actually, I feel a little unfortunate that there's been some stock hits recently and stuff.

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.700
So people have been saying to me, oh, you're getting out because of that.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.080
And it's like, no, no, no.

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:03.300
Actually, if anything, that would make me want to stay because as one of the people

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:07.960
who's been around a long time, you know, I have experience with the ups and downs of things.

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.780
It's been a lot lower historically at some point.

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:11.400
Oh, yeah.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:16.560
So every once in a while in your job, something comes up that's a little annoying,

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:17.720
and you think about things.

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:22.380
And I realized, oh, it has been 25 years.

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:27.080
And oh, I'm really loving this Python stuff, and I want to be part of the community.

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:32.720
And for all the wonderful things at Apple, the way it works right now is that you kind

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.680
of have to be invisible when you work there.

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:38.080
You know, you're not really allowed to speak, or you have to do a lot of work to be able

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:38.460
to speak.

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:42.660
You know, you can't necessarily write articles or write a book or whatever.

00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:46.220
So realizing that, okay, I've been here 25 years.

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:47.800
This is a really nice career progression.

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:49.860
I want to be a part of the Python community.

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:54.740
So I want to be able to be on a podcast, for example, and write a book.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:00.500
And also, honestly, to say, you know, well, if this is what I'm going to spend the next

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:04.820
chunk of my career on, yeah, I want to be working in the latest, greatest stuff.

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:10.320
And I felt personally that my responsibility, if I stayed, would be to put a lot of time and

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:15.520
effort into, you know, some of your other episodes have covered getting the whole organization

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:16.180
to switch.

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:21.520
And I've been through those conversions many times in my career, and it's just not what I

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:22.340
wanted to focus on.

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:24.120
I just wanted to make the jump.

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:27.660
And so you combine all those things, and it's like, yep, this is the right time to

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:28.000
do this.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.160
Yeah, it's definitely a good time to switch into Python.

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.020
It's, you know, so much energy, and it's definitely building.

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:35.180
And I can relate to a lot of those things.

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:39.620
You know, I worked at many small companies, but also at a large company.

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:44.820
And I just, for me personally, I just decided, you know, every day I get up and I go to these

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:47.160
meetings and I work on these features and these projects.

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:51.440
And there's a non-trivial chance this project is getting killed.

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:55.220
I'm pretty sure this feature is not actually going to make a difference to anybody, you

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:55.340
know?

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:59.820
And I just thought, well, is that kind of stuff what I want to put my energy into every

00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:00.040
day?

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:05.040
Like, what if I could wake up every day and work on what I think is going to be most valuable

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:08.540
to the community or people or customer, whatever, right?

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.480
Like, that would be really great, right?

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:15.540
So that's kind of what gave me a similar boost is just like, I feel like maybe I'm giving

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:18.340
like 20% of what I could to the world at my job.

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:18.980
Right, right.

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:22.520
Not because I'm not trying, but because I'm being told to work on X, Y, and Z.

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:25.280
And like, only Z is like partially valuable, right?

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.060
Yep, exactly.

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:26.540
Yeah.

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.660
Interesting.

00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:33.800
Okay, so you're starting off on this journey to do training, teaching, and your sort of own

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:34.040
thing.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.640
How can people, you already have some classes that you're teaching, right?

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:42.460
Yeah, I am definitely set up, as it happens, both in Python 2 and 3, to do the general new

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:43.800
programmers and experienced programmers.

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:48.500
And the same focus I talked about, for new programmers, it's just getting them comfortable

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:53.960
with what programming is and that they can solve problems and kind of setting them up to learn

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:54.600
more.

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:58.480
And with experienced programmers, it's really teaching them how to be Pythonic and how to

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.300
use the language the right way.

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:00.560
Nice.

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.820
And where can people find out about it?

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:06.380
So I have a site, which I'm still kind of, you know, working on getting up to speed.

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.740
But that is conquerprogramming.com.

00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:12.040
So I like the concept of conquer programming by learning Python.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.680
And they can go there.

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:17.920
And I'm on Twitter as conquerprogram1.

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.060
There was some other conquer program out there.

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:21.540
And that will do it.

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:21.860
Nice.

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:22.340
Okay, yeah.

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:23.900
So people can check that out if they're interested.

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:24.360
That's great.

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:25.840
All right.

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:30.320
Well, I guess we'll probably leave it there for the teaching at Apple topic.

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.480
And I'll just ask you the final two questions.

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:38.560
So if you're going to write some code, and based on what we talked about, I may have two good

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:38.860
guesses.

00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:42.140
But what editor do you use for Python anyway?

00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:43.940
So basically, I have three answers, right?

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:46.920
Sublime Text I use in classes, at least for students.

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:53.780
PyCharm I use if I really am needing to solve some bigger problems and use more of the profiling

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:55.260
and debugging sorts of stuff.

00:53:55.260 --> 00:54:00.000
As you can guess, at this point, my day to day coding and what I'm doing all my personal

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.280
stuff in is Jupyter.

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:05.700
Because I actually find it to even be a good development environment.

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:12.260
Because everything is in memory, when I'm having a problem, I just, I can interact live with what's

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:12.840
going on.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:14.280
It's like a super debugger, right?

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:15.740
You can just go, what is X?

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:20.260
And I love the fact that I can have actual documentation and links.

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:26.680
So I think now, if I were doing team development in Python, I would seriously consider having

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:30.960
the source be in Jupyter with actual documentation and actual links, and even things like screenshots.

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.200
So you can actually put in screenshots to show what it is that you're dealing with, say, on

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.460
a web page or something like that.

00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:41.760
And then if necessary, just export it to Python to be run on a day-to-day basis, but do the

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:42.720
actual source in Jupyter.

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:46.760
So I know that there are then challenges about importing things and other stuff.

00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:48.260
So there'd be things to figure out.

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:51.600
And I know that there's these JupyterLab and other stuff, which I haven't played with yet.

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.760
But that's definitely where I'm at.

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:54.880
And that's an interesting idea.

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.720
OK, notable PyPI package?

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:59.340
Well, I was thinking about what made the biggest difference.

00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:04.280
And so in Python 2, the biggest difference to me was a package called Unipath, because it

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:06.980
brought all the file functionality under one class.

00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:10.540
And so you didn't have to have three different libraries and different APIs.

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.260
And it really cleaned up my code.

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:14.780
And I know they proposed it.

00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:16.760
There was like a PEP for it at one point.

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:17.700
It got turned down.

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:22.260
And now there's Pathlib, which is part of Python 3.

00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:26.780
So I guess I would just say, if you're doing all the file stuff, I really would consider

00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:30.320
looking at Pathlib, because it just cleans up your code a lot.

00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.860
And it's a much nicer way to deal with things.

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:34.200
Yeah, that's a good recommendation.

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.940
And way to grab one out of the standard library.

00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:36.820
That also works.

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:41.300
So the other thing that I've started pushing in my experience classes when getting to the

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:46.480
data science stuff is in figuring out how to teach pandas, I started splitting out series

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:49.100
and teaching that first as kind of a fancy list and dictionary.

00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:52.060
And then a data frame just becomes a dictionary of series.

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:54.260
And it was easy for the students to absorb.

00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:59.140
And I started to realize, you know, as far as I'm concerned, I think the series class should

00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:05.420
be thought of as more of a general case problem solver, because it's a dictionary and it's

00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:06.800
a list and it does things really fast.

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:10.760
And it takes regular expressions, which is huge when you're doing a lot of the tech stuff.

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:19.160
So I've started pushing the idea of, hey, don't think of series as a spreadsheet thing.

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:23.460
Think of it as a really useful list class that you could use for anything.

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:25.400
So that's the other notable thing.

00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.000
Yeah, very interesting.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.860
I definitely like the Pathlib stuff these days.

00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:34.640
I'm starting to really appreciate it and think about, you know, ditching OS.path and all

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:37.440
because of the fluent API, the chaining, right?

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:43.120
Like create a path, dot, rename, you know, dot ensure the parent stuff, all that kind of

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.420
like all in one line.

00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:45.560
It seems really, really clean.

00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:47.660
So yeah, I like that recommendation as well.

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:48.160
All right.

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:48.900
Final call to action.

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:52.360
People are out there learning Python or they want to teach Python.

00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:53.920
You know, what advice do you have for them?

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:58.280
Well, I think I'm going to come back to a theme of this whole thing, which is if you're in an

00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:04.160
organization that's in Python 2, you've got to take personal responsibility to do something

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:04.640
about it.

00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:09.080
Either get your organization to change or think about your own role in that because do you want

00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:13.340
to be in a 10-year-old version of the language for the next five years or more?

00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:17.460
You know, coming from where I'm coming from, that's sort of the biggest thing for me.

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:22.680
I think the one other thing I would say in terms of teaching is one of the things I'm

00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:27.420
evolving towards and working on in this book I'm working on is I kind of think that teaching

00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:31.680
new programmers programming is almost the wrong thing.

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:36.220
And for many people, they're not there to become a programmer.

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:42.620
They're there because they have stuff in their work life that they want to improve and they want

00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:44.000
a new tool to do it.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:51.720
And I think that if we focus more of our teaching of new programmers around, hey, here's a problem

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:52.400
you can solve.

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.480
And by the way, along the way, you're going to learn some programming.

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:57.060
That's a much more practical way to do it.

00:57:57.060 --> 00:58:01.960
One of the books I really like along those lines is the Automate the Boring Stuff with Python,

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:04.340
which is very focused on that and influential to me.

00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:09.240
So even though I teach a generic learn how to program class, more and more I'm moving away

00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:12.760
from that and I'm going to focus on helping people solve specific problems.

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:18.120
Yeah, unless you're committed to a four-year computer science degree, you need those short

00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:18.620
little wins.

00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:22.460
It's not like, well, this year I'm going to learn all about loops and data structures.

00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.100
Next year I'll do something with it, right?

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:24.620
Yeah, exactly.

00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:29.460
That's not reasonable for most people, especially if it's a week-long class or something online

00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.240
for a few hours or something like that.

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:32.660
I totally agree.

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:34.000
All right, Ron.
